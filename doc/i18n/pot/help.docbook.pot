msgid "&krusader; is available in many languages, but usually several translations do need an update and new untranslated languages are always welcome, please read the &i18n_page_url; . Even when there is already a translator for your native language, it is always helpful to have a second or third translator &eg; for proofreading the translation. Sometimes, the regular translator is not available when a translation update is needed (studies, holyday, ...). Please contact the translator for your native language; he will appreciate very much that you will offer some help. Any translation (even partial translations) are accepted by the &krusader;-Krew at any time (feature freeze or not)."
