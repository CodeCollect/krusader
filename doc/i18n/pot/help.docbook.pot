msgid "&krusader; is available in many languages, but usually several translations do need an update and translations to new languages are always welcome, please read the &i18n-page-url; . Even when there is already a translator for your native language, it is always helpful to have a second or third translator &eg; for proofreading. Sometimes the regular translator is not available when a translation update is needed (studies, holiday...). Please contact the translator/s for your native language; your help will be appreciated. Any translation (even partial translations) are accepted by the &krusader;-Krew at any time (feature freeze or not)."
