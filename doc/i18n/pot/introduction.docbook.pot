msgid "Whether you are a &Linux; expert or a novice, &krusader; makes routine file management tasks quick and accurate, allowing you to focus on the big picture, not command line syntax. This is especially helpful if you are new to xxNIX operating systems. To do just that, &krusader; wears a great looking &GUI;, supports drag n' drop and mimetypes (with or without magic!) - all you need to feel right at home using it, right from the start!"

msgid "&krusader; is packed with cool features, is fast, and handles &archives_lnk; transparently. In addition, &krusader; streamlines many complex file management tasks, reducing fatigue, errors, and distraction. Basically, &krusader; provides all the helpful features you've come to expect from other quality file management tools like &mc; and &tcmd;. But why reinvent the wheel, you ask? &krusader; is designed to integrate seamlessly with the &kde; Desktop, the desktop of choice for many programmers, network engineers, and other power users of &Linux;. With &krusader; even novice users can quickly access the power, convenience, and feature rich capabilities of the &kde; Desktop. &krusader; is open-source, free, and is released under the &gpl_lnk;, although we (the developers) still retain the copyright for the project, its name, and manage the project's continuing evolution."

msgid "The &krusader; Project's mission is to create an \"all-in-one\" file manager, which will do all the ordinary things you'd expect from it, plus a lot more ... ;-) Since the principle behind &krusader; is based on the &ofm_url;, dual-pane filemanagers (&mc;, &nc;, &etc;), it is a given that &krusader; handles all the standard Copy, Move, Delete, &etc; file operations, but that is just the foundation!"

msgid "From the start, virtual filesystems became a main focus. &vfs_lnk; are an abstracted layer over all kinds of archived information (ZIP files, &FTP; servers, TAR archives, NFS filesystems, SAMBA shares, ISO cd/dvd images, RPM catalogs, &etc;), which allows the user to access all the information in these divergent types of filesystems transparently - just like entering an ordinary sub-directory! Files can then be copied or moved from and to (except ISO,rpm,tar.gz) these data sources/containers with the click of a mouse. &krusader; currently supports VFSs for all popular [and some specialized] types of archives (ace, arj, bzip2, gzip, iso, lha, rar, tar, zip and 7-zip), configuration packages (rpm, deb), and traditional remote filesystem types (&FTP;, NFS, Samba, FISH, SFTP)."

Need temporary Root access to your files? Simply \"SU\" within a Terminal window or click on &krusader;'s \"Root Mode\" to bring up a new &krusader; Manager as Root!"

msgid "Advanced users benefit greatly from being able to carry out clerical tasks effortlessly, without distraction from the real task at hand; a big help during those late night edit/compile sessions. Convenient shortcut keys enable you to navigate directory trees with ease, create multiple tabbed directory views simultaneously, and access fully functional history lists - all with a single mouse click! Due to efficient programming and low system overhead, &krusader; is perhaps the most responsive all around system management tool you can use to access the full potential of your computer using &kde;, or with any other standards compliant X Windows window manager. Although designed specifically for, and tightly integrated with, &kde;; &krusader; works equally well with Gnome, Enlightenment, WindowMaker, IceWM, BlackBox, Wiamea, XFCE, etc. -- when the &kde; libraries are installed."
