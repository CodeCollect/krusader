msgid "&krusader; has many useful features. It is fast, and handles &archives-lnk; transparently. In addition, &krusader; streamlines many complex file management tasks, reducing fatigue, errors, and distraction. Basically, &krusader; provides all the helpful features you have come to expect from other quality file management tools like &mc; and &tcmd;. &krusader; is designed to integrate seamlessly with the &kde; Desktop, the desktop of choice for many programmers, network engineers, and other power users of &Linux;. With &krusader; even novice users can quickly access the power, convenience, and feature rich capabilities of the &kde; Desktop. &krusader; is a free open-source project, and it is released under the &gpl-lnk;, although the developers still retain the copyright for the project and its name, and manage the project's continuing evolution."

msgid "The &krusader; Project mission is to create an \"all-in-one\" file manager, which will do all the ordinary things you would expect of it, and more. Since the principle behind &krusader; is based on the &ofm-url;, dual-pane filemanagers (&mc;, &nc;, &etc;), it is certain that &krusader; is able to handle all the standard Copy, Move, Delete, &etc; file operations."

msgid "From the start, virtual file systems became the main focus. &vfs-lnk; are an abstracted layer over all kinds of archived information (ZIP files, &FTP; servers, TAR archives, NFS filesystems, SAMBA shares, ISO cd/dvd images, RPM catalogs, &etc;), which allow the user to access all the information in these divergent types of file systems transparently - just like entering an ordinary sub-directory. Files can then be copied or moved around (except ISO,rpm,tar.gz) between these data sources/containers effortlessly. &krusader; currently supports VFSs for all popular and some specialized types of archives (ace, arj, bzip2, gzip, iso, lha, rar, tar, zip and 7-zip), configuration packages (rpm, deb), and traditional remote file system types (&FTP;, NFS, Samba, FISH, SFTP)."

msgid "Advanced users benefit greatly from being able to carry out clerical tasks effortlessly, without distraction from the real task at hand. Convenient shortcut keys enable the user to navigate directory trees with ease, create multiple tabbed directory views simultaneously, and access fully functional history lists. Due to efficient programming and low system overhead, &krusader; is perhaps the most responsive all around system management tool used to access the full potential of a computer using &kde;, or any other standards compliant X Windows window manager. Although designed specifically for, and tightly integrated with, &kde;; &krusader; works equally well with Gnome, Enlightenment, WindowMaker, IceWM, BlackBox, Wiamea, XFCE, etc.as soon as the KDE libraries are installed."
