msgid "MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted filesystems. Once invoked, it displays a list of every mounted filesystem. For each filesystem, MountMan displays it's name (which is the actual device name - &ie; <filename class=\"directory\">/dev/fd0</filename> for a <hardware>floppy</hardware>), it's type (vfat, ext3, ReiserFS ...) and it's mount-point on your system (the directory on which the filesystem is mounted)."

msgid "MountMan also displays usage information using total size, free size, and percentage of available space free. If those numbers say <guilabel>N/A</guilabel>, it usually means that the filesystem isn't mounted. Left clicking on a filesystem displays a pie chart on the left of the window, this graphically displays the usage information for the filesystem. Clicking on a non-mounted filesystem will display <guilabel>not mounted</guilabel> instead of the graph."

msgid "General idea: display a list of all possible mountpoints. Each time the menu is displayed, it determines if a mountpoint is mounted or not and associates the correct action (mount or umount). This offers a quick interface to MountMan. It is working, and currently uses KMountMan::mount and unmount. It uses the new &kde; services for fstab-reading and this will enable us to remove A LOT of code from the \"old\" MountMan."
