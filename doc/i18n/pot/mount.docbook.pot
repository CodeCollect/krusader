msgid "MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted file systems. Once invoked, it displays a list of every mounted file system. For each file system, MountMan displays its name (which is the actual device name - &ie; <filename class=\"directory\">/dev/fd0</filename> for a <hardware>floppy</hardware>), its type (vfat, ext3, ReiserFS ...) and its mount point on your system (the directory on which the file system is mounted)."

msgid "MountMan also displays usage information using total size, free size, and percentage of available space free. If those numbers say <guilabel>N/A</guilabel>, that usually means that the file system is not mounted. Left clicking on a file system displays a pie chart on the left of the window, graphically displaying the usage information for the file system. Clicking on a non-mounted file system will display <guilabel>not mounted</guilabel> instead of the graph."

msgid "General idea: display a list of all possible mount points. Each time the menu is displayed, it determines if a mount point is mounted or not and associates the correct action (mount or umount). This offers a quick interface to MountMan. It is working, and currently uses KMountMan::mount and unmount. It uses the new &kde; services for fstab-reading and this will enable us to remove a lot of code from the \"old\" MountMan."
