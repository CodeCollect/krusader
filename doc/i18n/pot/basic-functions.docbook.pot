Queueing is used for one-by-one copying. E.g. if you have a pen drive (which is slow), and you want to copy 40 files onto it, it's much better copying them one-by-one instead of starting to copy 40 files parallelly. That's why enqueuing is important. If you pack/unpack 40 files parallelly, you overload your computer, but adding them to a queue (which is not yet implemented into Krusader), is much more useful."
