If you can't find a package that matches your distribution version, architecture or distribution, then use a source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the Krusader sources will be built, on your computer, guaranteeing a suitable binary RPM for your specific distribution and architecture. In addition, this method results in maximum system speed, since the resulting binary is customized for your computer. Please read the previous question, it explains how to install a source RPM.

Just trying to read something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The one and only way around this architectural problem is using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck, we don't hang the entire application event loop, but we don't think that the time is right for adding threads, we are not sure that *all* the &kde; systems out there are using &Qt;-mt (the multi threaded version of the &Qt; library), and the Krusader Krew may not be the right people to address this major issue in any case; so currently this is just a bug we have to learn to live with."

In this sense, a software project differs from, let's say a wiki: a software project has to have someone to make all the final decisions. Otherwise the software will not work. Furthermore: keep in mind that the examination of patches might take time, as we all have private lives."
