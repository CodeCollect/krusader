msgid "As you may notice, this handbook is written by various authors. The draft explanation of new features is done by the developers on the krusader-devel mailinglist, the editors add this information in this handbook. We have taken much care in ensuring technical and vocabulary consistency. The authors write in English even though it is not their native language; therefore, you may notice strange sentence constructions. Do not hesitate to let us know, if something is not clear to you."
