msgid "Welcome to &krusader;'s powerful search module - nicknamed KruSearcher. It is the most able tool (that we know of) for &Linux;, since it allows so many different ways to quickly find the file you are looking for. The search function is also available on remote file systems. It is divided into two levels, the general and the advanced. Let's take a look at the general page."
