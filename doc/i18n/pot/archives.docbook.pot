msgid "The &vfs-lnk; allows you to browse archives as if it was a directory. Currently &krusader; supports the following archives types: ace, arj, bzip2, deb, gzip, iso, lha, rar, rpm, tar, zip and 7-zip and supports the following passworded archives: arj, ace, rar and zip. Passwords can be stored in &kwallet;. Please note that the archive support first needs to be properly <link linkend=\"konfig-archives\">configured</link> in Konfigurator. To open the archive, use &Enter;, (double-)click or the <keycap>Right Arrow</keycap>. &krusader; supports also <emphasis role=\"bold\">hidden archives</emphasis>, these are renamed archives with a *wrong* extension, &eg; &openoffice; uses zip archives with the following extensions: odt, sxw and odw. &Enter; will open the &openoffice; document and the <keycap>Right Arrow</keycap> will open the archive. Another example is J2EE, where the rar extension means a zip archive. Since &krusader; auto-detects the supported archive types, it will open with <keycap>Right Arrow</keycap> even if it has another mime type. Please note that browsing archives has a few limitations:"
