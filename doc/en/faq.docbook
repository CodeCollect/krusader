        <question id="faqi_kdelibs">
          <para>Does &amp;krusader; need &amp;kde; to run?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
          <emphasis>No, &amp;krusader; does not need the &amp;kde;
          window manager</emphasis>to run on your computer but
          &amp;krusader;'s natural environment is &amp;kde;,
          because it relies on services provided by the &amp;kde;
          base libraries. Only some shared libraries are needed
          &amp;eg; &amp;kde; libraries, &amp;Qt; libraries,
          &amp;etc; This means that &amp;krusader; runs on
          &amp;gnome_url;, &amp;afterstep_url;, &amp;xfce_url; and
          other window managers provided the approriate libraries
          are installed on your computer. All this is not a problem
          since the apt-get world can resolve these dependencies
          instantly.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>You don't need to switch to the &amp;kde; window
          manager to use &amp;krusader;; you can still use
          &amp;gnome_url;, &amp;afterstep_url;, &amp;xfce_url; or
          another window manager. However, the configuration of the
          &amp;krusader; fonts and some behavior is done by running
          
          <command>Kcontrol</command>.</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>A lot depends on what you would like to do with
          &amp;krusader;. You should know that &amp;krusader; uses
          the &amp;kde; &amp;kioslaves1_url; to access remote file
          systems, and support for only a limited number of
          filesystem types are shipped with &amp;kdelibs_url;, most
          of the &amp;kioslaves2_url; are bundled with
          &amp;kdebase_url; (including fish, sftp and tar). But ...
          if the property-dialog should show EXIF-data for .jpeg's,
          you need &amp;kde;graphics if you want ID3-infos, you
          need &amp;kde;multimedia, and so on....</para>
          <para></para>
          <!-- Empty line to make it more readable -->
          <para>To summarize, if you want a working &amp;krusader;
          - install &amp;kde;libs. If you want a functional
          &amp;krusader; then you need &amp;kde;libs +
          &amp;kde;base. For maximum functionality, &amp;krusader;
          needs all of the &amp;kde; package libraries, but the
          &amp;kde; window manager is optional.</para>

          <para>Which libraries does &amp;krusader; need to

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>For running &amp;krusader; (&amp;eg; when you have
          installed &amp;krusader; with a binary RPM) you need less
          libraries than if you compile &amp;krusader; from source.
          &amp;eg; you only need the C-compliler &amp;gcc; when you
          compile &amp;krusader; from source (see the next
          question).</para>

          <para>Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers
          from the libs. The headers are needed to compile
          &amp;krusader;. Look for packages in the form
          foo-devel-*.rpm (&amp;eg; 
          <filename>kdelibs-devel-foo.i586.rpm</filename>) or
          foo-dev-*.deb for &amp;debian; based distributions. These
          are usually included with your distribution.

            </userinput>
          </screen>If the prompt returns without any message, than
          everything is OK. RPM's downloaded from our website are
          usually provided by &amp;krusader; users. Visit your
          distro website and search for an updated RPM.</para>
          <para>If the RPM is not OK, try to find another package
          at &amp;Linux; software archives such as
          &amp;freshmeat_url; or &amp;kde_apps_url;. If you still
          can't find the appropriate package for your &amp;Linux;
          distribution, we recommend searching for it with
          &amp;rpmfind_url; or &amp;rpmpbone_url;.</para>
          <para>In general, a package for an older version of your
          distrubution or even for another distribution might work
          on your computer (&amp;eg; FC RPM's often work on Mdk and
          RH, and vice versa), but it is always the best that you
          install only RPM's that exactly match your distribution.
          If you can't find a package that matches your
          distribution version, architecture or distribution, then
          use a source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the Krusader
          sources will be built, on your computer, guaranteeing a
          suitable binary RPM for your specific distribution and
          architecture. In addition, this method results in maximum
          system speed, since the resulting binary is customized
          for your computer. Please read the previous question, it
          explains how to install a source RPM. The best solution
          is explained in the next question.</para>

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Check if your distribution provides &amp;krusader;,
          if it doesn't than contact your distribution creator and
          ask them to include &amp;krusader;!</para>
          <para>Did you take a look at the &amp;URL;'s on the
          &amp;install_proc_lnk; page? Yes, and nothing found? Then
          you can compile &amp;krusader; from source :) Even if you
          think that you have no skills, you will probably succeed
          in compiling &amp;krusader;! We provide a very detailed
          installation procedure. This HowTo enables newcomers to
          compile &amp;krusader; from source, even if they have

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>In this case only the 
          <guimenu>Help</guimenu>menu is visible and all other menu
          items like &amp;eg;

          <guimenu>Select</guimenu>are missing. This is because
          some distributions put the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename>file in the wrong
          directory. To solve the problem, just copy the 
          <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename>file from the package

          re-run &amp;krusader;. If you have compiled
          &amp;krusader; from sources this is often caused when the

        <question id="faqi_nvidia">
          <para>I have a 
          <filename>libGLcore.so.1</filename>compile error after
          using the &amp;nvidia; installer</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>This problem occurs when you use the &amp;nvidia;
          installer and not the official &amp;nvidia; packages of
          your distribution. &amp;krusader; is based on &amp;Qt;
          which can be linked against the X OpenGL libraries. As a
          result &amp;krusader; may look for OpenGL as well. The
          problem is that the &amp;nvidia; installer (prior to
          version 7xxx) doesn't do its job properly, it replaces
          the OpenGL header files (which get included into
          &amp;krusader;) but doesn't set the libGL links
          correctly. The best solution is to use the &amp;nvidia;
          packages provided by your distributor or a new
          &amp;nvidia; installer, the current version at moment of
          writing is 7114. If, for some reason, you must use an old
          &amp;nvidia; driver, one solution is the following (bad?
          :) hack, the exact commands depend on the distribution
          used and the version of the &amp;nvidia; driver (6111 in
          this example), but it should read something like this:

        <answer>
          <para>We've been received a lot of emails and bug reports
          (December 2005) regarding random crashes in
          &amp;krusader;, especially during some file operations
          (copy/move etc.). 
          <emphasis role="bold">These crashes are related to
          &amp;Qt; 3.3.5 and NOT &amp;krusader;.</emphasis>It seems
          that &amp;Qt; 3.3.5 introduced a serious bug which is
          currently (December 2005) causing random crashes in many
          &amp;kde; applications including &amp;konqueror;. You can
          Google for it to find out more. As far as we know,
          &amp;debian;-Sid and &amp;SuSE; already posted new
          &amp;Qt; binaries that fix the problem, and &amp;gentoo;
          has masked &amp;Qt; 3.3.5 completely. As for now, you
          either need &amp;Qt; 3.3.4 or a fixed &amp;Qt; 3.3.5 or a
          higer version, depending on your distribution. More

        <question id="faqu_supermount">
          <para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy,
          &amp;krusader; says something about supermount, what's
          this about?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Supermount is a daemon which handles the
          mounting/unmounting of removable filesystems for you.
          Just insert a floppy, and do 
          <userinput>
            <command>cd</command>
            <option>
              <replaceable>/mnt/floppy</replaceable>
            </option>
          </userinput>supermount will do the mount for you
          automatically and transparently. All this is great,
          however, supermount misleads the system into thinking
          that the 
          <hardware>floppy/cdrom</hardware>is mounted at all times!
          This creates some problems for &amp;krusader;, as it
          cannot really know when the floppy or CD has been removed
          because the system information is not correctly updated
          by supermount - is there really a 
          <hardware>floppy</hardware>in the 
          <hardware>drive</hardware>? Of course, this can be
          solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a priority.

          <para>Why does &amp;krusader; freeze or hang on a dead
          mountpoint?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>When &amp;krusader; is &amp;eg; browsing a NFS
          share and the NFS server goes down, then &amp;krusader;
          will freeze. This &amp;krusader; (and all other open
          internal viewers/editors) freeze is fatal, and can only
          be corrected with the 
          <command>kill -9</command>. We have no solution to offer
          here. This is an issue not confined to file managers, or
          even the &amp;Linux; OS! The problem is that you "hang"
          on the first access to the dead share - so there is no
          way around it, no check to avoid it, even 
          <command>ls</command>will freeze. Just trying to read
          something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The
          one and only way around this architectural problem is
          using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck,
          we don't hang the entire application event loop, but we
          don't think that the time is right for adding threads, we
          are not sure that *all* the &amp;kde; systems out there
          are using &amp;Qt;-mt (the multi threaded version of the
          &amp;Qt; library), and the Krusader Krew may not be the
          right people to address this major issue in any case; so
          currently this is just a bug we have to learn to live
          with.</para>

          lot: when downsizing the buttons will look like 'F5
          ..py'. When the button faces are too small to read a
          tooltip will give the complete text. The minimum width is
          45 pixels for each button.</para>

        <answer>
          <para>This error will happen on &amp;debian; (or
          &amp;debian; based) distro with the
          krusader_1.51-1_i386.deb package. You will see the next
          error message if you try to open the handbook: "The
          requested help file could not be found. Check that you
          have installed the documentation." To fix it go to 
          <filename>
          /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/krusader/</filename>, you will
          see the 
          <filename>foo.docbook.gz</filename>files. Now, you need
          to extract all these files with root priveleges
          ("File-&gt;Unpack" with &amp;krusader;) to create 
          <filename>foo.docbook</filename>files. Now the handbook
          will work. This error is fixed in the
          krusader_1.60.0-1_i386.deb package and higher
          versions.</para>

          <para>Unfortunately the 1.70.x version contains a bug.
          The tabs are not saved if a "Panels Save Settings=Tabs"

          <para>An open source project's greatest strength is
          derived from getting user feedback. That is why we love
          to hear what you have to say. Your "Gripes" are our
          instructions. After about 6 months, programmers can no
          longer see their own mistakes. It's natural. We want the
          ideas, xritiques, and feedback because we all want to
          make &amp;krusader; the best, most useful, file manager
          available anywhere.</para>
          <para>The most convenient way to contact us is to use the
          &amp;forum_lnk;, or the krusader-users
          &amp;mailing_lists_url;. For information on what remains
          to be done look at the &amp;todoforum_url;. Adding ToDo
          items into the &amp;todoforum_url; is for developers
          only, but feel free to post to the &amp;featureforum_url;
          for things that aren't on the &amp;todoforum_url;, but
          should be. If you have a nice feature request, the
          &amp;krusader; Krew will add your request to the
          &amp;todoforum_url;. We review and discuss every
          submission. For more information how the forum works

              behind the patched module. Here a software project
              differs from lets say a wiki: in a software project
              there is someone, who makes the final decission.
              Otherwise software will not work. Furthermore: Keep
              in mind, that the examination of patches might take
              time, as we all have private lifes.</para>

          the &amp;kruforum_url;, your issue may have been
          previously discussed (this allows us to minimze the
          double/triple/... postings). If your issue has already
          been discussed in the past there is a great chance that
          you will have an instant solution for your issue/problem.
          If the issue is currently being discussed, you can join
          in the discussion. Some questions are asked over and over
          again, for these we have made the &amp;faq_lnk; ;-) This
          also allows us also to spend more time in developing
          &amp;krusader;.</para>
          <para>The &amp;kruforum_url; is split into six sections:

              able to VOTE and COMMENT on the TODO items. Here you
              get the chance to push your favourite features (+3)
              and still prefer certain features over others (+1),
              if you don't care about a feature just simply don't
              vote on that feature. Unregistered users may only
              browse the &amp;todoforum_url;. The
              &amp;todoranking_url; contains the results based on
              the votes.
