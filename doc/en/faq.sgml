    <question><para>Where can i report bug/wish/patch ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>An open source project greatest strength is derived from getting user
    feedback. That why we'd love to hear what you have to say. You can reach us by
    <ulink url="mailto:krusader@users.sourceforge.net">mail</ulink> or drop us a note
    in the <ulink url="http://krusader.sourceforce.net/phpBB/">krusader forum</ulink>.</para></answer>

	  <question><para>I've installed Krusader from RPM, but when I run it, the menus don't appear.
    Why ?</para></question>
	  <answer><para>Some distributions put the 'krusaderrc.ui' file in the wrong place.
    To solve the problem, just copy the file (form the package or the installed path)
    to either $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader or ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader and re-run the
    program.</para></answer>

	  <question><para>Why can't I change the colors in Krusader ?
    (or: I used to be able to change the colors in prior versions, but not anymore -
    what's up with that ?)</para></question>
	  <answer><para>In versions prior to 0.75, we supported changing some of the colors
    in Krusader. After some debates in the KDE mailing-list regarding the matter, we decided
    that Krusader's colors will match KDE's current color-scheme. This makes Krusader more
    compatible and coherent. As a result, we don't support changing colors inside the program.
    Sorry.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader says
    something about supermount, what's this about ? </para></question>
    <answer><para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable
    filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and 'cd /mnt/floppy' - supermount will do
    the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
    supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is mounted
    at all times ! This creates a few problems for Krusader, as it can't really know what's
    going on - is there really a floppy in the drive ? Of course, this can be solved, but
    as for now, we don't consider it a priority.</para></answer>
