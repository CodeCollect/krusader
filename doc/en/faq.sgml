    <question><para>Where can i report bug/wish/patch ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>An open source project greatest strength is derived from getting user
      feedback. That why we'd love to hear what you have to say. See the file TODO in the distribution
      for information on what remains to be done or look at the website.
      You can reach us by <ulink url="mailto:krusader@users.sourceforge.net">mail</ulink> or drop us a note
      in the <ulink url="http://krusader.sourceforce.net/phpBB/">krusader forum</ulink></para>
      <para><remark><keycap>If you've got bugs to report, please use the krusader website, and
      not KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).</keycap></remark></para></answer>

	  <question><para>I've installed Krusader from RPM, but when I run it, the menus don't appear.
                            Why ?</para></question>
	  <answer><para>Some distributions put the 'krusaderrc.ui' file in the wrong place.
             To solve the problem, just copy the file (form the package or the installed path)
             to either $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader or ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader and re-run the
             program.</para></answer>

      <question><para>Why can't I change the colors in Krusader ?
          (or: I used to be able to change the colors in prior versions, but not anymore -
          what's up with that ?)</para></question>
      <answer><para>In versions prior to 0.75, we supported changing some of the colors
          in Krusader. After some debates in the KDE mailing-list regarding the matter, we decided
          that Krusader's colors will match KDE's current color-scheme. This makes Krusader more
          compatible and coherent. As a result, we don't support changing colors inside the program.
          Sorry.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader says
             something about supermount, what's this about ? </para></question>
    <answer><para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable
       filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and 'cd /mnt/floppy' - supermount will do
       the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
       supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is mounted
       at all times ! This creates a few problems for Krusader, as it can't really know what's
       going on - is there really a floppy in the drive ? Of course, this can be solved, but
       as for now, we don't consider it a priority.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When i try to resize Krusader, so that it'd be smaller, i discover i can't
      resize it below a certain size. Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. why?</para></question>
    <answer><para>See the F1, F2 (etc.) buttons ? they are not allowing krusader to downsize as
      they have a minimum size. just disable them (view->Show FN Keys Bar) and you'll be able to
      resize krusader to your liking.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When i do some file operation, Krusader's panel doesn't refresh / I'm using
       Krusader with fam installed, but updates to the panel are now shown.</para></question>
    <answer><para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but seems that fam doesn't always seem to
      work for us. We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo installation: one worked,
      the other did not. The good news is that if you disable fam, Krusader will automatically revert
      to its internal mechanism (which is less efficient, but works) without needing to recompile.</para></answer>

    <question><para>Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / What to do if Krusader does not read shared directories
    containing national characters?</para></question>
    <answer><para>Krusader does not handle (yet) samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a codepage different
      than 8859-1 you wil have todo a manual configuration.
      Create or modify the file: ~/.smb/smb.conf
      <screen>
	[global]
 	workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
 	client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
 	character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)</screen>

     Unfortunately kcontrol (KDE 3.1.1) fails to configure it properly, so
     this step must be done with a text editor.</para></answer>
