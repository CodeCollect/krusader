    <question id="wish_patch"><para>Where can I report a wish, a patch or a comment ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>An open source project greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback.
      That's why we'd love to hear what you have to say. For information on what remains to be done look at the
      &online_todolist_url;.
      Posting to the online todo list is for developers only, but feel free to post to the &kru2forum_url;
      for things that aren't on the list, but should be. If you have a nice feature request, the &krusader; Krew
      will add your request to the online todo list. You can reach us by &mail_url;
      or drop us a note in our &kruforum_url;.

    <question id="bug_report"><para>Where can I report a bug ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>We have a online Bug Tracking System.</para>
    <para>Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly way to know how many bugs are open,
    bug priority and follow-ups. It saves us the long time needed to browse the entire &krusader; forum,
    searching for yesterday's bug. Please use this system.</para>
    <para>Before reporting a bug, please regard the following:
    <orderedlist>
    <listitem><para><keycap>Search</keycap> the &kruforum_url;
    , your bug might be solved already. Please DO NOT post new bugs to the &bugforum_url;. We keep it
    open to allow discussions.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><keycap>Check</keycap> if the bug is already posted in the &online_buglist_url; of the
    Bug Tracking System.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>If you can't find this bug mentioned, please <keycap>submit</keycap> it into the bug tracker by
    clicking the "Submit New" button in the bug-tracker window.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist></para>
    <para>Thanks for your cooperation!</para>
    <note><para><remark>If you've got bugs to report please do not use &kde;'s bugzilla http://bugs.kde.org/,
    &kde;'s Bug Tracking System.</remark></para></note></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
    <question><para>Does &krusader; have a mailing list ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>Yes, it is called &krunews_url;.
      This list is used to notify &krusader; users about new releases, major bugfixes etc.
      No spam, no bother, just &krusader;. To see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the
      &krunewsarch_url;.
      </para><para>See also &krulatestnews_url; for online announcements.
      </para><para>If you want to follow the &krusader; development ... live ! A &krucommits_url; is available.
      That means that everything the development team puts into CVS is reported in the list. Want to keep track?
      Waiting for a certain feature/bugfix? Feel free to subscribe.
      To see the collection of prior CVS commits visit the &krucommitsarch_url;.

   <qandaentry id="krusaderrc_ui">
	  <question><para>I've installed &krusader;, but when I run it, the menus don't appear.
                            Why ?</para></question>
	  <answer><para>Probably only the <guimenuitem>help</guimenuitem> menu is visible and all the other
	  menu's are gone. Some distributions put the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file in the wrong place.
	  To solve the problem, just copy the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file
	  (from the package or the installed path) to either
	  <userinput>$KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader</userinput>
          or <userinput>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader</userinput> and re-run the program.
          If you have compiled &krusader; from sources this is often caused when the
          &kdeqtdir_lnk; enviroment variables are not right set.</para></answer>
   </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
      <question><para>Some menu items are missing, what is wrong ?</para></question>
      <answer><para>When upgrading to a newer Krusader version the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename>
      must be upgraded to, sometimes this is not the case. The solution is explained in the previous
      question.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

   <qandaentry>
      <question><para>Why can't I change the colors in &krusader; ?</para></question>
      <answer><para>In versions prior to 0.75, we supported changing some of the colors
          in &krusader;. After some debates in the &kde; mailing-list regarding the matter, we decided
          that &krusader;'s colors will match &kde;'s current color-scheme. This makes &krusader; more
          compatible and coherent. As a result, we don't support changing colors inside the program.
          Sorry.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
    <question><para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, &krusader; says
             something about supermount, what's this about ? </para></question>
    <answer><para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable
       filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and 'cd /mnt/floppy' - supermount will do
       the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
       supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is mounted
       at all times! This creates a few problems for &krusader;, as it can't really know what's
       going on - is there really a floppy in the drive? Of course, this can be solved, but
       as for now, we don't consider it a priority.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
    <question><para>When I try to resize &krusader;, so that it'd be smaller, I discover that I can't
      resize it below a certain size. Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?</para></question>
    <answer><para>See the F1, F2 (etc.) buttons ? They are not allowing &krusader; to downsize as
      they have a minimum size. Just disable them (view->Show FN Keys Bar) and you'll be able to
      resize &krusader; to your liking.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
    <question><para>When I do some file operation, &krusader;'s panel doesn't refresh / I'm using
       &krusader; with fam installed, but updates to the panel are now shown.</para></question>
    <answer><para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but seems that fam doesn't always seem to
      work for us. We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo installation: one worked,
      the other did not. The good news is that if you disable fam, &krusader; will automatically revert
      to its internal mechanism (which is less efficient, but works) without needing to recompile.
      You can disable fam (file alteration monitor) with:
      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>su -c 'fam -l'</command></userinput></screen>
      Look at te manpages for more information about fam.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
	  <question><para>When i run <command>make</command> it complains about
	                   <filename>libfam.la</filename></para></question>
	  <answer><para>The './configure' script does not check for the presence of 'libfam.la', and
	  make needs 'libfam.la' to compile &krusader;. Install 'libfam0-devel-foo.rpm'.
	  Note: when you install Mandrake 9.1 with the default settings, this package is not installed.

      <question><para>I have trouble with compiling and installing &krusader;, what to do now ?</para></question>
      <answer><para>Please read our detailed <link linkend="compilation">installation procedure</link>.
      If you can't find any solution for your problem then feel free to post a help request at our
      &kruforum_url;.</para></answer>

    <question><para>Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / What to do if &krusader; does not read shared directories
    containing national characters?</para></question>
    <answer><para>&krusader; does not handle (yet) Samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a codepage different
      than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration.
      Create or modify the file: ~/.smb/smb.conf
      <programlisting>
 	[global]
 	workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
 	client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
 	character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)</programlisting>

     Unfortunately kcontrol (&kde; 3.1.1) fails to configure it properly, so
     this step must be done with a text editor.</para></answer>

      <question><para>&krusader; reports "krarc:... protocol not supported" error at opening an archive file.
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>Solution: install the krarc slave properly:</para>
        <para>Copy the kio_krarc.so, kio_krarc.la files into <userinput>$KDEDIR/lib/kde3</userinput></para>
        <para>Copy the krarc.protocol file into <userinput>$KDEDIR/share/services</userinput></para>

      <question><para>When i try a to establish a ftp-connection, i get an error message after 'Connect OK'
       saying 'Could not connect to host'.</para></question>
      <answer><para>You are probably behind a firewall/proxy and haven't enabled Passive Mode.
      Enable Passive FTP through &kde;'s Control Center and try again.
      Network -> Preferences -> 'Use Passive Mode' has to be checked.
