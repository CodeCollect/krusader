  <question id="faqq_kru_forum">
  <para>How does the &krusader; forum works?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>In the spirit of freedom of speach, everything what is &krusader; related can be discussed in our forum.
         But please regard the following, so that we can maintain some order in the chaos. ;-)</para>

  <para>Please use the <emphasis role="bold">Search</emphasis> function of the &kruforum_url;, your issue is maybe
         discussed already (this allows us to minimze the double/triple/... postings).
         If your issue was already discussed in the past there is a great chance that you have an instant solution
	 for your issue/problem.
         Some issues are asked over and over again, for this issues whe have the made the FAQ's. ;-)
         This also allows us also to spend more time in developing &krusader;.</para>

  <para>If the forum, documentation and FAQ's can't help you, do not hesitate to drop a posting in our forum.
         The &krusader; Krew or the &krusader; forum community is always available to help you.
	 Note: with your feedback we can make &krusader; better and better, otherwise we are maybe not
	 aware about some issues.</para>

  <para>The &kruforum_url; is split up in three major sections:
  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>&bugforum_url;: discussions about bugs, please DO NOT use the forum for &faqbugreports_lnk;
                         (except if you are not sure that you have found a bug).</para></listitem>

   <question id="faqq_missing_libs">
   <para>I have followed all steps but <command>configure</command> complains about missing libs or headers.
         What to do?</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
   <para>Install them. ;-)</para>
   <para>Here is a (obviously incomplete) list of &krusader;'s dependencies:</para>

     </itemizedlist></para>
     <para>Most RPM-based distributions seperate the headers from the libs. The headers are needed to compile
           &krusader;. Look for packages in the form foo-devel-*.rpm (&eg;
           <filename>kdelibs-devel-3.1-58mdk.i586.rpm</filename>)
           or foo-dev-*.deb for Debian based distributions. They most likely come with your distribution.
      <tip><para>If you can't find the needed package, use the &rpmfind_url; and click

          Here, the binary somehow made it into <filename class="directory">/usr/local/bin</filename>.
          It is most likely, that your

   <question id="krusaderrc_ui">
   <para>I've installed &krusader;, but when I run it, only the <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu>
	 menu appears. Why?</para></question>
   <answer>
   <para>Only the <guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem> menu is visible and all the other menu's are gone.
   Some distributions put the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file in the wrong place.
   To solve the problem, just copy the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file
   (from the package or the installed <envar>PATH</envar>) to either
   <filename>$KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderrc.ui</filename>
   or <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderrc.ui</filename> and re-run the program.
   If you have compiled &krusader; from sources this is often caused when the
   &kdeqtdir_lnk; enviroment variables are not right set.
   Note: We are thinking to write code that the &krusader; binary checks at every start the existence and
   validity of the used <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file, at the moment of writing this feature is not
   supported yet by &krusader;, but it will ;-).

  <qandaentry>
  <question id="missing_menus">
  <para>Some menu items are missing, what is wrong?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>When upgrading to a newer &krusader; version the <filename>krusaderrc.ui</filename> file
        must be updated to. If this file is missing, only the help menu appears.
        If this file is too old, the new menu elements will not be shown.
        Unfortunately at changing the toolbar, &kde; makes a copy of that file in the home directory,
        and if someone updates &krusader;, the new menu elements will be inaccessable because of using the
        old <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename>.
        The solution is explained in the previous question.

  <question id="libfam_la">
  <para>When I run <command>make</command> it complains about <filename>libfam.la</filename></para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>The <command>./configure</command> script does not check for the presence of
	<filename>libfam.la</filename>, and <command>make</command> needs <filename>libfam.la</filename>
	to compile &krusader;. Install <filename>libfam0-devel-foo.rpm</filename>.
	Note: when you install <application>Mandrake 9.1</application> with the default settings, this

   <question id="color_change">
   <para>Why can't I change the colors in &krusader;?</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
   <para>In versions prior to 0.75, we supported changing some of the colors
          in &krusader;. After some debates in the &kde; mailing-list regarding the matter, we decided
          that &krusader;'s colors will match &kde;'s current color-scheme. This makes &krusader; more
          compatible and coherent. As a result, we don't support changing colors inside the program.
          Sorry.
          Note: We are planning to write code to use "Colorize files by type" (request id. 735649).
	  btw. the &krusader; Krew is experimenting at this moment to (re)introduce color support,
	  so there is hope ;-)

  <question id="supermount">
  <para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, &krusader; says
             something about supermount, what's this about? </para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable filesystems for you. 
       Just insert a floppy, and do 
       <userinput><command>cd</command> <option><replaceable>/mnt/floppy</replaceable></option></userinput> 
       supermount will do the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
       supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the <hardware>floppy/cdrom</hardware> is mounted
       at all times! This creates a few problems for &krusader;, as it can't really know what's going on -
       is there really a <hardware>floppy</hardware> in the <hardware>drive</hardware>?
       Of course, this can be solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a priority.
       Feel free to write a patch for it ;-).

  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>See the <guibutton>F1, F2</guibutton> (&etc;) buttons? They are not allowing &krusader; to downsize as
      they have a minimum size. Just disable them
      <emphasis role="bold"><menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>

       &krusader; with fam installed, but updates to the panel are now shown.</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
   <para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but seems that <application>fam</application> doesn't always 
      seem to work for us. Feel free to write a patch for it ;-).
      We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo installation: one worked,
      the other did not. The good news is that if you disable <application>fam</application>, &krusader; will 
      automatically revert to its internal mechanism (which is less efficient, but works) without needing to 
      recompile.
      You can disable <application>fam</application> (file alteration monitor) with:
      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>su -c 'fam -l'</command></userinput></screen>
      Look at the manpages for more information about <application>fam</application>.

  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>&krusader; does not handle (yet) <application>Samba</application> ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a 
        codepage different than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration.
        Create or modify the file: <filename>~/.smb/smb.conf</filename>
        <programlisting>
 	[global]
 	workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
 	client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
 	character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)</programlisting>

     Unfortunately <application>kcontrol</application> (&kde; 3.1.1) fails to configure it properly, so
