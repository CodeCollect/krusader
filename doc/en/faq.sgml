    <question id="bug_report"><para>Where can I report a bug ?</para></question>
    <answer><para>We have a online Bug Tracking System.</para>
    <para>Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly way to know how many bugs are open,
    bug priority and follow-ups. It saves us the long time needed to browse the entire Krusader forum,
    searching for yesterday's bug. Please use this system.</para>
    <para>Before reporting a bug, please regard the following:
    <orderedlist>
    <listitem><para><keycap>Search</keycap> the &kruforum;
    , your bug might be solved already. Please DO NOT post new bugs to the

    "Report Bugs" button.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>If you can't find this bug mentioned, please <keycap>submit</keycap> it into the bug tracker by
    clicking the "Submit New" button in the bug-tracker window.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist></para>
    <para>Thanks for your cooperation!</para>

	  <question><para>I've installed Krusader from RPM, but when I run it, the menus don't appear.
                            Why ?</para></question>
	  <answer><para>Some distributions put the 'krusaderrc.ui' file in the wrong place.
             To solve the problem, just copy the file (form the package or the installed path)
             to either $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader or ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader and re-run the
             program.</para></answer>

      <question><para>Why can't I change the colors in Krusader ?</para></question>
      <answer><para>In versions prior to 0.75, we supported changing some of the colors
          in Krusader. After some debates in the KDE mailing-list regarding the matter, we decided
          that Krusader's colors will match KDE's current color-scheme. This makes Krusader more
          compatible and coherent. As a result, we don't support changing colors inside the program.
          Sorry.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader says
             something about supermount, what's this about ? </para></question>
    <answer><para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable
       filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and 'cd /mnt/floppy' - supermount will do
       the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
       supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is mounted
       at all times ! This creates a few problems for Krusader, as it can't really know what's
       going on - is there really a floppy in the drive ? Of course, this can be solved, but
       as for now, we don't consider it a priority.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When I try to resize Krusader, so that it'd be smaller, I discover that I can't
      resize it below a certain size. Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?</para></question>
    <answer><para>See the F1, F2 (etc.) buttons ? They are not allowing Krusader to downsize as
      they have a minimum size. Just disable them (view->Show FN Keys Bar) and you'll be able to
      resize krusader to your liking.</para></answer>

    <question><para>When I do some file operation, Krusader's panel doesn't refresh / I'm using
       Krusader with fam installed, but updates to the panel are now shown.</para></question>
    <answer><para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but seems that fam doesn't always seem to
      work for us. We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo installation: one worked,
      the other did not. The good news is that if you disable fam, Krusader will automatically revert
      to its internal mechanism (which is less efficient, but works) without needing to recompile.
      You can disable fam (file alteration monitor) with:
      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>su -c 'fam -l'</command></userinput></screen>
      Look at te manpages for more information about fam.</para></answer>
  </qandaentry>

  <qandaentry>
	  <question><para>When i run 'make' it complains about 'libfam.la'</para></question>
	  <answer><para>The './configure' script does not check for the presence of 'libfam.la', and
	  make needs 'libfam.la' to compile Krusader. Install 'libfam0-devel-foo.rpm'.
	  Note: when you install Mandrake 9.1 with the default settings, this package is not installed.

    <question><para>Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / What to do if Krusader does not read shared directories
    containing national characters?</para></question>
    <answer><para>Krusader does not handle (yet) samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a codepage different
      than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration.
      Create or modify the file: ~/.smb/smb.conf
      <screen>
	[global]
 	workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
 	client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
 	character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)</screen>

     Unfortunately kcontrol (KDE 3.1.1) fails to configure it properly, so
     this step must be done with a text editor.</para></answer>

  <qandaentry>
      <question><para>Krusader reports "krarc:... protocol not supported" error at opening an archive file.
      </para></question>
      <answer><para>Solution: install the krarc slave properly:</para>
        <para>Copy the kio_krarc.so, kio_krarc.la files into <userinput>$KDEDIR/lib/kde3</userinput></para>
        <para>Copy the krarc.protocol file into <userinput>$KDEDIR/share/services</userinput></para>
        <para>or the directory where the KIO slaves are placed in your &Linux; distribution.
