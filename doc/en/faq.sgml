     <para>Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers from the libs. The headers are needed to compile
           &krusader;. Look for packages in the form foo-devel-*.rpm (&eg;
           <filename>kdelibs-devel-3.1-58mdk.i586.rpm</filename>)
           or foo-dev-*.deb for Debian based distributions. They most likely come with your distribution.
      <tip><para>If you can't find the needed package, use the &rpmfind_url; and click
		 'missing lib or header' in the search line.
		 Or use <command>apt-cache search <replaceable>foo</replaceable></command> to find the

   <question id="binary">
   <para>I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package), but it fails. What's wrong?</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
   <para>Since we only provide (and use) the source, we don't know.
   Try to find another binary at &Linux; software archives such as &freshmeat_url; or &kde_apps_url;.
   If you can't find a RPM package for your &Linux; distribution, we recommend searching for it with
   &rpmfind_url; or &rpmpbone_url;.
   Or better, please try to compile the &krusader; sourcecode.
   We provide a verry detailled &install_proc_lnk; if you have never done a compilation before.
   Feel free to post a &help_request_lnk; if you encounter problems.

   <question id="krusaderui_rc">
   <para>I've installed &krusader;, but when I start it, only the <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu>
	 menu appears. Why?</para></question>
   <answer>
   <para>In this case only the <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu> menu is visible and all the other menu items
   like &eg; <guimenu>"File"</guimenu> and <guimenu>"Mark"</guimenu> are gone.
   This is because some distributions put the <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file in a wrong directory.
   To solve the problem, just copy the <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file
   from the package <filename>krusader_kde3/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> to
   <filename>$KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename>
   and <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> and re-run &krusader;.
   If you have compiled &krusader; from sources this is often caused when the
   &kdeqtdir_lnk; enviroment variables are not right set, the result is that the
   <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file is installed in a wrong directory.
   Please read also the next question.</para>

  <qandaentry>
  <question id="missing_menus">
  <para>Some new menu items are missing after updating &krusader;, what is wrong?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>The <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file is stored in
       <filename>$KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename>.
       When you change the <guilabel>"Toolbar"</guilabel>, &kde; makes a copy of that file in the home directory at
       <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename>.
       If Krusader was previously installed on your computer, and you install a newer &krusader; version the
       <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> file must be replaced with the newer version.
       </para>

  <para>The first line of <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> contains the version number.
        After installing a newer &krusader; stable version, &kde; will replace automatiqly the old
        <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> with the newer version when starting the
        new &krusader; stable for the first time (&kde; will detect the newer version number in the first line).
        In the past this was not the case due to a bug, this bug was resolved since "krusader-cvs-2004-02-24".
        When you install a Krusader CVS or beta version you will have to replace the
        <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> manually.</para>

  <para>If the <filename>~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc</filename> file is too old,
        then the new menu elements will not be shown.
        Read the previous question for information on how to update the <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> file.
        If <filename>krusaderui.rc</filename> is missing or in a wrong directory,
        only the <guimenu>"Help"</guimenu> menu appears, please read the previous question.

  <question id="libfam_la">
  <para>When I run <command>make</command> it complains about <filename>libfam.la</filename></para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>The <command>./configure</command> script does not check for the presence of
	<filename>libfam.la</filename>, and <command>make</command> needs <filename>libfam.la</filename>
	to compile &krusader;. If you know how this can be solved, please let us know.
	Install <filename>libfam0-devel-foo.rpm</filename>.
	Note: when you install <application>Mandrake 9.1</application> with the default settings, this
	package is not installed.

  <question id="supermount">
  <para>When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, &krusader; says
             something about supermount, what's this about? </para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of removable filesystems for you.
       Just insert a floppy, and do
       <userinput><command>cd</command> <option><replaceable>/mnt/floppy</replaceable></option></userinput>
       supermount will do the mount for you automatically and transparently. All this is great, however,
       supermount manipulates the system into thinking that the <hardware>floppy/cdrom</hardware> is mounted
       at all times! This creates a few problems for &krusader;, as it can't really know what's going on -
       is there really a <hardware>floppy</hardware> in the <hardware>drive</hardware>?
       Of course, this can be solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a priority.

  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>See the <guibutton>F1, F2</guibutton> (&etc;) buttons? They are not allowing &krusader; to downsize as
      they have a minimum size. Just disable them
      <emphasis role="bold"><menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu>

  <para>When I do some file operation, &krusader;'s panel doesn't refresh / i'm using
       &krusader; with fam installed, but updates to the panel are now shown.</para>
   </question>
   <answer>
   <para>The bad news is that we're not sure why, but seems that <command>fam</command>
      (file alteration monitor) sometimes refuses to work.
      Feel free to write a patch for it ;-).
      We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo installation: one worked,
      the other did not. The good news is that if you disable <application>fam</application>, &krusader; will
      automatically revert to its internal mechanism (which is less efficient, but works) without needing to
      recompile.
      You can disable <application>fam</application> with:
      <screen><prompt>$</prompt> <userinput><command>su -c 'fam -l'</command></userinput></screen>

  <para><application>Samba</application> ISO 8859-x codepage / what to do if &krusader; does not read shared
        directories containing national characters?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>&krusader; does not handle (yet) <application>Samba</application> ISO 8859-x codepages, if you use a
        codepage different than 8859-1 you will have to do a manual configuration.
        Create or modify the file: <filename>~/.smb/smb.conf</filename>

 	client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)

  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>The reason of this error is that '&FTP; via &HTTP; proxy' feature is not yet supported by &krusader;.
        This error can occur at misconfiguring the proxy settings in &kde; (Control Center).
        Modify the proxy setting to not use &HTTP; proxy and &FTP; will work.

  <question id="faqq_kru_forum">
  <para>How does the &krusader; forum work?</para>
  </question>
  <answer>
  <para>In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that is &krusader; related can be discussed in our forum.
        It does not matter that you are a newcomer or an advanced user, everybody is welcome.
        An open source projects greatest strength is derived from getting user feedback.
        That is why we love to hear what you have to say.
        With your feedback we can make &krusader; better and better, otherwise we are not aware of issues you may have.
        But please regard the following, so that we can maintain some order in the chaos. ;-)</para>

  <para>If the <link linkend="index">Documentation</link>, &faq_lnk; and the &kruforum_url; can't help you, do not
         hesitate to drop a posting in our forum.
         The &krusader; Krew or the &krusader; forum community is always available to help you.</para>

  <para>Please use the &kruforumsearch_url; function of the &kruforum_url;, your issue may have been
         previously discussed (this allows us to minimze the double/triple/... postings).
         If your issue has already been discussed in the past there is a great chance that you will have an instant solution
	 for your issue/problem.
         Some issues are asked over and over again, for this issues whe have the made the &faq_lnk;. ;-)
         This also allows us also to spend more time in developing &krusader;.</para>

  <para>The &kruforum_url; is split up in three major sections:
  <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>&bugforum_url;: discussions about bugs, please DO NOT use the forum for &faqbugreports_lnk;
                         (except if you are unsure if you have found a bug).</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>&featureforum_url;: discussions about new features for future &krusader;
                       versions.</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>&krugenforum_url;: everything that is &krusader; related and doesn't belong in the other
                       forums.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>
