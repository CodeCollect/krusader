  <title>Compilation and installation</title>

  <para>
  In order to compile and install Krusader make sure that the $KDEDIR environment variable is
  defined on your system and is pointing to your KDE directory.
  You can test this by typing:
  <screen width="40">
  <prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>echo $KDEDIR</userinput>
  </screen>
  in your shell prompt, the response should be your KDE directory.
  If $KDEDIR is not defined or is not pointing to the right directory,
  you may fix this with the following command:
  <screen width="40">
  <prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>export KDEDIR="replace with your kde dir"</userinput>
  </screen>
  </para>

  <para>
  After $KDEDIR is set, type the following in the base
  directory of the Krusader distribution:
  <screen width="40">
  <prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>./configure</userinput>
  <prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make</userinput>
  <prompt>%</prompt> <userinput>make install</userinput>
  </screen>
  the "make install" command must be executed as root.
  </para>

  <para>Since Krusader uses autoconf and automake you should have no trouble compiling it.
  Should you run into problems please report them to us by email or use our web forum.
