        <para><keycap>Important: RemoteMan has been replaced by our new bookmark manager since Krusader 1.25-beta1.
                          The new manager handles local files and remote url the same way.
                          RemoteMan is being left around to allow an easier transition and
                          give you a chance to move your bookmarks. IT WILL BE REMOVED SOON!</keycap></para>

                 <para>Try the new bookmark-manager: open a new remote connection. once
                        done, press the bookmark button, select 'Add bookmark' and that's it!

      <para>
	RemoteMan is a central place for all your FTP/SMB needs. It is a tree-like list of remote locations,
	each with its own username and password. You can create new "folders" (or groups) in the tree and place
	remote sessions inside the groups. Each session includes a name (something that best describes the url)
	and a host. A hostname is a url which can begin with 'ftp://' or 'smb://'. Additional information that
	can be filled is the username and password. Not filling these values will trigger an anonymous login. You
	can also click the 'anonymous' checkbox, which will force an anonymous login. One can also decide on a
	different port - or keep the default 21. If you choose a 'smb://' host, you cannot change the port.
	Optional are the description (a freetext area) and remote directory. If you enter a remote directory,
	Krusader will try, upon connection, to cd into that directory.</para>

	<para>MountMan is a tool which helps you manage your mounted filesystems. Once invoked, it displays
	a list of every mounted filesystem. For each filesystem, MountMan displays its name (which is the
	actual device name - i.e. /dev/fd0 for a floppy), its type (vfat, ext2 ...) and its mount-point
	(the directory on which the filesystem is mounted). MountMan also displays usage information using
	total size, free size and free percentage. If those numbers say "N/A", it usually means that the filesystem
	isn't mounted. Left clicking on a filesystem displays a pie chart on the left of the window, which
	graphically displays the usage information for the filesystem. Clicking on a non-mounted filesystem will
	display "not mounted" instead of the graph.</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Double clicking on a filesystem will close MountMan and open that filesystem
		inside Krusader's active panel.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Right clicking on a filesystem will open a small menu which displays what actions can
		be performed on that filesystem. For now, you can only mount, unmount and eject (if clicked on a
		removable filesystem - a cdrom).</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<note><para>We plan to expand MountMan in the next evolution of Krusader. It'll be able to format floppies,
	edit /etc/fstab, create new filesystems and more...</para></note>

<title>Book Man: Organize your bookmarks</title>
	<para>Note: since Krusader 1.25-beta1 we have a new bookmark system. The old bookmark manager doesn't
	exist anymore and is be replaced by KeditBookmarks.</para>
	<para>BookMan is a tool which allows you to bookmark folders and URL's using Krusader, and later return to
	them in a click of a button. All you need to do is click on the "bookmark" button.</para>

	</screenshot>
	<para>Usually, you click on the "bookmark" button when you're in the target folder. For example, to bookmark
	 '/usr/tmp', navigate Krusader there and click the <keycap>bookmarks button</keycap> and the <keycap>add
	 bookmark</keycap> button. When the "add bookmark" window appears, the URL line will say '/usr/tmp'. The upper
	 line (Bookmark name) is what you like to call the bookmark (for example: temporary folder). If you add the
	 bookmark without entering a name, the bookmark's name will be the same as its target. With the "New Bookmark
	 folder" button you can create a new bookmark folder.</para>
	<note><para>You can bookmark inside a remote filesystem (FTP or SAMBA) and later use the bookmark to quickly connect
	to the remote machine. You CANNOT bookmark inside an archive.</para></note>
	<para>To use your new bookmarks, click the "bookmark" button and choose one - as shown in the picture above.
        You may also use the keyboard shortcut <keycap>Alt+right/left arrow</keycap> to <keycap>open right/left
        panel bookmarks list</keycap></para>

	<para>To edit and organize your bookmarks, click the <keycap>edit bookmarks</keycap> button,
        KeditBookmarks will be displayed. This is where you can edit/remove and re-arrange the bookmarks.
        KEditBookmarks (part of the kdebase package) is a bookmark editor for Konqueror and Krusader,
        which use the <ulink url="http://grail.sourceforge.net/info/xbel.html">XBEL standard</ulink> for the bookmark
        format. The bookmarks are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krbookmarks.xml.</para>
	<para>You can inport bookmarks from IE, Opera, Galeon, KDE, Mozilla, Netscape.
        KeditBookmarks is easy to use, please read the KeditBookmarks or the Konqueror handbook if you need more
	info.</para>

<sect1 id = "krusearcher">
<title>KruSearcher: find what you're looking for</title>
	<para>Welcome to Krusader's new and powerful search module - nicknamed Krusearcher. It is the most able
	tool (that we know of) for Linux, since it allows so many different ways to quickly find the file you're
	looking for. It is divided into two levels, the general and the advanced. Let's take a look at the general
	page ...</para>
	<screenshot>
		<screeninfo>Krusearcher general</screeninfo>
		<mediaobject>
		<imageobject><imagedata fileref="search_general.png" format="PNG"/></imageobject>
		<imageobject><imagedata fileref="search_general.eps" format="EPS"/></imageobject>
		<textobject><phrase>Screenshot</phrase></textobject>
		</mediaobject>
	</screenshot>
	<para>The page is divided into four parts: top (search for) part, bottom part - titled 'containing text',
	left part - titled 'search in' and right part which is called 'don't search in'. Obviously, each part
	handles different aspects of the search. Let's look at them closely.</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Search for: here you enter the main search criteria. You can enter a filename, a wildcard
		(*.o.*, *.c etc.) or both - seperated by a space. Notice, the "case sensative" button below this line.
		Unchecking it will allow lower and upper case search (ie: *.c interprets as *.c AND *.C).</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Of type: this box let's you search for a file not only by its name, but also by its
		mimetype. For example, you can search for all the audio files whose name begins with B. Usually this
		option defaults to 'all files', but you can choose to search for archives, directories, images, text
		files, videos and audio files.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Search in (also Don't search in): Using those two parts, you can specify a search exactly
		the way you want it. For example, you might want to search for a file in the whole filesystem (beginning
		with /), but don't want to search inside /mnt. All you need to do is write '/' in the 'search in' box,
		and write '/mnt' in the 'dont search in' box. If you want to enter more than one directory in one of the
		boxes, just write the first name and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. The directory's name will be copied to
		the bigger box and you'll be able to enter another name.
			<note><para>The input line has an auto completion feature, corrosponding to KDE's global settings.
			If you wish, you can click on the folder icon, and browse to the directory you wish to add.</para></note>
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Text: entering text here makes Krusader search for it inside the files (grep).
		That way, you can search for all header files (*.h) which include the word 'krusader' inside them.
		Notice, the 'case sensative' checkbox. It refers to your text being searched for in upper and lower case
		or the exact phrase you entered.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Search in directories: do a recursive search and dive into every directory
		on the way.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Search in archives: Krusader will search for your files inside every supported archive.
		This, however, takes longer to perfrom.<note><para>If you check this checkbox, you'll notice you cannot
		'grep' inside files anymore. This is done, since looking inside files which are archived, forces Krusader
		to extract them, which will results in an extremely long search.</para></note></para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Follow links: if checked,  Krusader will follow soft-links during the search.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>The screenshot shows a search for all the files which end with c, cpp or h and include the string
	'testing 123'. Krusader will search in /root, /opt, /bin and /usr, but not in /usr/lib and /usr/share.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>Clicking the search button starts the search and displays the results page. During the search, you
	may press the stop button to stop the search. The close button is not operational during a search, so you
	must first stop the search and then close the window. When a result is found, double clicking on it will
	make Krusader's active panel point to the found files - but will not close the search window, so you'll be
	able to click on a different result.</para>
	<para>Sometimes, you need to narrow your search even more. Krusearcher allows a much finer search, and
	for that, let's look at the advanced page...</para>

	</screenshot>
	<para>This screenshot shows a search for files which size is between 10KB and 150KB, which were modified
	between October 10th and November 1st. Which belong to any user in the 'ftp' group, and are readable and
	writeable by anyone in the 'ftp' group but only readable to the rest of the world.</para>
	<para>The advanced page is divided into three parts: size, date and ownership.</para>
	<para>Size</para>
	<para>Allows you to choose the size range of the file you're looking for. By checking the checkboxes, you can
	search for a file which is bigger than XXX bytes (or KB, MB), smaller than XXX bytes or, by checking both,
	search for a file which size is bigger than XXX but smaller than YYY.</para>
	<para>Date</para>
	<para>This part offers three different ways of defining a date criteria:
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Modified between: allows you to enter two dates. Krusader will search for files with
		a modification date between the first date and the second one. If you only enter a date in the left
		box, you'll be searching for files older than that date. If you only enter a date in the right box,
		you'll be searching for files newer than that date.<note><para>You can click on the date icon (near the
		input boxes) to open a standard date window - which allows you to easily browse through the calender
		and search for the desired date. Clicking on a date will close the window and the date will appear in
		the input box.</para></note></para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Not modified after: choosing this option makes Krusader search for files that were NOT
		modified after a given date, which is the same as searching for files older than that date.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Modified in the last / not modified in the last: in these input boxes, you enter not a
		date, but a number. This number represents days/weeks/months (as chosen in the near dropbox). Entering
		the number 5 in the upper input box, makes Krusader search for files that were modified in the 5 days.
		Entering the number 2 in the lower input box makes Krusader search for files that did NOT change in the
		last 2 days. The combination of both results in a search for files that were changed in the last 5 days,
		but NOT in the last 2 days.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist></para>
	<para>Ownership</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Belongs to user / group: by checking each of the corrosponding checkboxes, you can
		search for files which belong to a certain user and/or group. The dropbox lists all the user names and
		group names in the system, just choose one and go ahead.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Permissions: divided into owner, group and all - it allows you to choose certain
		permissions for the file. You can choose to specify permissions for the owner, group, all or any
		combination. The question mark (?) is a wildcard - which means that any permission is valid.
		<note><para>To clarify, the screenshot above (the permissions part) describes a search for files
		that belong to any user in group 'ftp', are readable, writable but not executable to any user in
		the group, are readable but not writable or executable to the rest of the world and have unknown
		permissions to its owner.</para></note></para></listitem>
