<title>Konfigurator: Making Your Own Krusader</title>
<para>Konfigurator is Krusader's configuration center. Here you can modify the way Krusader does
things and customize it to your own needs. At all times, pressing the <keycap>OK</keycap> button
will apply the changes, pressing <keycap>Cancel</keycap> will cancel them, and pressing
<keycap>Defaults</keycap> will reapply Krusder's "factory" settings. Konfigurator is divided
into pages, each containing items related to that page.</para>

	<para>The startup page determines the way Krusader look (and work) when it is launched.
	It is divided into two main parts:</para>
  <variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term><guilabel>Panels</guilabel></term>
		<listitem><para>Save settings on exit: when Krusader launches, the panels current
		directory will be the same as it was, when Krusader was shutdown - providing the location is
		within a local filesystem.</para>
		<para>Start with the following settings: allows you to define a startup status
		for each of the panel in the following manner:
		</para>
    <itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Panel types: select one of the available combinations.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Panel starts at: the following options are available
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem><para>homepage: This panel will start at a specified homepage. In this case, you also need to
					choose a directory in which will be this panel's homepage.</para></listitem>
					<listitem><para>workdir: This panel will start at the folder it was executed from.</para></listitem>

	<para>Here you can determine the look and feel of things - which basically means fine-tuning the
	application to you needs. The page is divided into three tabs: <guilabel>General</guilabel>,
	<guilabel>Toolbar</guilabel> and <guilabel>Key-bindings</guilabel>. Since <guilabel>Toolbar</guilabel>
	and <guilabel>Key-bindings</guilabel> are KDE's standard toolbar and keyboard editor, we'll focus on
	the <guilabel>General</guilabel> section:</para>

	<sect2 id="konfig-lookNfeel-General">
        <title>General</title><para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Warn on exit: if checked, Krusader will display an "Are you sure ?"
		warning when you're trying to shut it down. Otherwise, it will exit without protest.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Minimize to tray: if checked, when you minimize Krusader, its icon will appear in the
		system tray instead of the taskbar.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Show hidden files: if checked, Krusader will display the "dot files" which are
		otherwise hidden.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Automark directories: when marking a group of files (either by using Select Group
		or by using Select All), Krusader will check this option. If it is checked, than directories matching
		the select criteria will also be marked. Otherwise, only files will be marked.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Case sensitive sorting: if checked (the Unix default), than all files beginning with
		capital letters appear before files beginning with non-capital letters, otherwise, all files begining
		with a specified letter (capital or otherwise) will appear together.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Panel font: allows you to change the font used inside the file
		lists.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Filelist icon size: allows you to change the size of the icons in the file lists.
		available sizes are 16x16, 22x22, 32x32 and 48x48 pixels.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>HTML viewer's minimal font size: when viewing an HTML file (usually using
		<keycap>F3</keycap>), Krusader invokes KDE's built-in HTML parser. This option sets the
		minimal font size for the viewer, and aligns other font sizes according to it.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Mouse selection modes: three modes are available,
			<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>Classic: the way Krusader used to work from day one. Both keys allow selecting
			files. To select more than one file, hold the <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key and click the
			<keycap>left</keycap> mouse button. Right-click menu is invoked using a short click on
			the <keycap>right</keycap> mouse button.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Left mouse button selects: this way, pressing the <keycap>left</keycap>
			mouse button selects files - you can click and select multiple files. Right-click menu is
			invoked using a short click on	the <keycap>right</keycap> mouse button.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>Right button selects: this way (sometimes referred to as 'windows commander
			style') the <keycap>left</keycap> mouse button does not select, but sets the current file
			without affecting the current selection. The <keycap>right</keycap> mouse button selects
			multiple files and the right-click menu is invoked by <guilabel>pressing and
			holding</guilabel> the <keycap>right</keycap> mouse button.</para></listitem>

	<para>The following options determine basic aspects of operation:
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Delete files / Move to trash: when Krusader deletes files it can either 'really' delete them
		or move them to the trash folder, thereby making them available via KDE's trash.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Use mimetype magic: mimetype magic is a mechanism which allows Krusader to inspect the files
		in the panels and determine their type even if the file has no identifying extention. For example, if
		you take an image file - 'image1.jpg' - and rename it to 'image1', Krusader will still know it's an
		image file and work with it accordingly. However, this mode of operation is slower (while refreshing
		the panel, or changing directories), so try Krusader with and without mimetype magic and decide what's
		best for you</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Editor: choose what editor will be used when editing a file (via F4).</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Terminal: choose what terminal emulator will be used when Krusader opens a console window
		(via F2, or Commands->Terminal menu option).</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Temp directory: this option selects the base directory for Krusader's temporary files. The
		actual files will be created in separate directories under the 'Temp directory', so that each user
		running Krusader will have his/hers own temporary subdirectories under the chosen directory.
		<note><para>You must choose a temporary directory such that all the users who are running Krusader will have
		full permissions to it !</para></note></para></listitem>

	<para>This page handles more advanced issues, so you should double-check what you do here, since modifying
	things around here makes Krusader a more powerful AND dangerous tool.</para>
	<para>The page is divided into three parts:</para>
	<variablelist>
	<varlistentry><term><guilabel>General</guilabel></term>
	<listitem>
  <itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>I AM ROOT: usually, when doing any operation, Krusader checks permissions. This means that if
		root wants to remove a folder owned by a user, Krusader will not let him/her do that !!! By checking
		this option, you make Krusader assume you are root, which means that Krusader WON'T DO ANY PERMISSION
		CHECKS ! AT ALL ! NOTHING ! This obviously makes life easier for power users, but it also means that if
		you make a mistake, there's no going back ! and you won't even get a warning. USE WITH CAUTION !</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Automount filesystems: this makes Krusader try to mount a filesystem before entering it. For
		example, if you'd click on /mnt/cdrom (and /mnt/cdrom appears in /etc/fstab as a mount point), Krusader
		will check if it is mounted. If not, it will try and mount it for you and then enter, so that you'd see
		the contents of your cdrom. Note, however, that Krusader will NOT unmount when exiting /mnt/cdrom.</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist></listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Confirmations</guilabel></term>
		<listitem><para>By checking the options in this section, you'll make Krusader ask for confirmation before
		doing the specific action. Otherwise, the actions will be done without warning.</para>
	</listitem></varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	<term><guilabel>Fine-Tuning</guilabel></term>
	<listitem><itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Icon cache size: Krusader uses an icon cache, so it won't have to reload icons that were
		already used before. Ofcourse, as the cache grows bigger, it can store more icons and further speed
		operations, but the memory footprint of Krusader will be bigger.</para></listitem>

	<para>This page handles the way Krusader works with archives. In the <guilabel>General</guilabel> section
	you'll see a list of archive formats. Some are checked and some are grayed-out. The ones that are available
	(not grayed-out) are supported by Krusader. If  you check them, than Krusader will handle them transparently
	and let you open them as folders. Otherwise, Krusader will attempt to invoke an application which opens that
	type of archive. If a certain archive is grayed-out, it means that Krusader couldn't find the appropriate
	executables in the PATH (to handle ZIP archives, Krusader needs 'unzip' and 'zip' executables).</para>
	<para>If you've installed a certain archive application (let's say 'arj') and want Krusader to know about
	it, just click the 'Auto Configure' button. Krusader will search for all supported executables, and print
	a report regarding what archives can be handled. If all went well, the new archive will be availble and
	checked.
  <note><para>Please install new archives to your PATH (ie: /usr/bin; /usr/local/bin etc.)</para></note></para>
	<para><guilabel>Fine-Tuning</guilabel>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>Allow moving into archives: this option allows you to move files into an archive (as opposed
		to just copying into the archive). The down side is that if a power failure occurs during the process,
		the files that were moved might already be deleted, but not yet packed into the archive.
    <note><para> If such thing happens, the file are NOT LOST. they were actually moved into a subfolder in the
		Krusader's temp directory.	You can search that directory and find your files, safe and sound.
		</para></note></para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Test archives when finished packing: this option automatically runs a test on a newly packed
		archive. It is safer, but takes longer.</para></listitem>
