1.12 beta1
======================
    ADDED: some GUI touch-ups: make buttons smaller, and bars leaner. all in
           all, the thing should look better.
    ADDED: FreeBSD compatability issues - patchs by Heiner, thanks man!

1.10 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: new and improved viewer.
    ADDED: Krename support ! (more info at: http://krename.sf.net )
    ADDED: you can now use the command line to "cd" into konqi-supported urls.
           ( try: cd audiocd:/?dev=/dev/cdrom )
    ADDED: you can try to execute files in remote filesystem.
    ADDED: new command detection function instead of using 'which'

    FIXED: rewritten the panel sorting function, it should be better and faster
           now.
    FIXED: back to KRDirWatch, since KDirWatch crashed us on systems with FAM
           enabled.
    FIXED: removed the "panel start path is invalid" error message. if the
           start path is invalid try to find the closest path (the previous
           solution was '/');
    FIXED: don't watch read-only/not-readable directories - this should improve
           performance and avoid a loooong wait time on super-mounted cdroms.
    FIXED: multiple selctions modes are no-more. default mode is Konqueror.
           the multi-mode become unstable after the kde3 porting and we had to
           disable it.

           equivelent keyboard short-cut), will open the usual dialog with 4 new
           options in the predefined selections. This allows automatic selection
           of files according to their compare-mode status - newer, older, etc.
    ADDED: Terminal emulator now "follows mouse" - konqueror style.
    ADDED: French translation.
    ADDED: A new icon for Krusader. new we've got krusader.png and
