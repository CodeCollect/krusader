1.12 beta1
======================
    ADDED: some GUI touch-ups: make buttons smaller, and bars leaner. all in all, the
           thing should look better.
    ADDED: FreeBSD compatability issues - patchs by Heiner, thanks man!
    ADDED: move to next-gen view (at last)

    FIXED: minor bug in mountman

    ADDED: new Spanish translation, thanks to Rafa Munoz.
    ADDED: new Polish translation, thanks to Lukasz Janyst.

    FIXED: Changed the internal viewer default from Hex to Text.
    FIXED: Crash when Krusader is called with open viewer/internal editor.
    FIXED: Keyboard shortcuts not saved in Konfigurator.    

1.10 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: new and improved viewer.
    ADDED: Krename support ! (more info at: http://krename.sf.net )
    ADDED: you can now use the command line to "cd" into konqi-supported urls.
           ( try: cd audiocd:/?dev=/dev/cdrom )
    ADDED: you can try to execute files in remote filesystem.
    ADDED: new command detection function instead of using 'which'

    FIXED: rewritten the panel sorting function, it should be better and faster now.
    FIXED: back to KRDirWatch, since KDirWatch crashed us on systems with FAM enabled.
    FIXED: removed the "panel start path is invalid" error message. if the start
           path is invalid try to find the closest path (the previous solution was '/');
    FIXED: don't watch read-only/not-readable directories - this should improve performance
           and avoid a loooong wait time on super-mounted cdroms.
    FIXED: multiple selctions modes are no-more. default mode is Konqueror.
           the multi-mode become unstable after the kde3 porting and we had to disable it.
    FIXED: memory leak when starting konfigurator.

    ADDED: sftp & scp support.
    ADDED: multi-protocol and history to the new connection
           dialog.

    FIXED: normal_vfs now uses the KDE dir watch,
           in other words: better directory refresh.
    FIXED: new 'admin' folder.

1.0.1 - KDE 3
======================
    ADDED: Krusader now compiles on KDE 3 (tested with RC3).
    ADDED: New ftp/smb vfs due to KDE 3 API changes.


1.0.1
======================
    ADDED: When compare-mode is active, pressing the 'Select Files' icon (or the
           equivelent keyboard short-cut), will open the usual dialog with 4 new
           options in the predefined selections. This allows automatic selection
           of files according to their compare-mode status - newer, older, etc.
    ADDED: Terminal emulator now "follows mouse" - konqueror style.
    ADDED: French translation.
    ADDED: A new icon for Krusader. new we've got krusader.png and krusader2.png !

    FIXED: errors compiling on kde 2.1 - convertSizeFromKB
