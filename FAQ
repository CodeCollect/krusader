IMPORTANT: Crashes in Krusader caused by Qt 3.3.5
*************************************************
We've been getting a lot of emails and bug reports regarding random
crashes in Krusader, especially during some file operations (copy/move etc.).
These crashes are related to Qt 3.3.5 and NOT Krusader.
It seems that Qt 3.3.5 introduced a serious bug which is now causing random 
crashes in many KDE applications including Konqueror.
You can google for it to find out more. 

As far as we know, debian and suse already posted new Qt binaries that fix the
problem, and gentoo has masked Qt 3.3.5 completely.
As for now, you either need Qt 3.3.4 or a fixed Qt 3.3.5, depending on your
distribution. For more information is available on our website at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=1407

Chapter 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   If you have problems with Krusader please check the
   Installation procedure, your problem may be due to a bad
   installation.

   The FAQ is divided into three sections:

     * Installation FAQ (this page)
     * Usage FAQ (issues when running/using Krusader)
     * General FAQ (bug reports, forum, mailing list, ...)

   If you have the feeling that a FAQ is missing or if something
   is not clear to you, please let us know.
     _________________________________________________________

7.1. Installation FAQ

   7.1.1. Does Krusader need KDE to run?
   7.1.2. Which libraries does Krusader need to run?
   7.1.3. I have followed all steps but configure complains about
          missing libs or headers. What do I need to do?

   7.1.4. How do I compile Krusader when I'm using a 64 bit
          processor ?

   7.1.5. I have downloaded the Source RPM
          krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm What now?

   7.1.6. I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package),
          but it fails. What's wrong?

   7.1.7. I can't find a RPM or DEB package for Krusader, What
          now?

   7.1.8. I've installed Krusader, but when I start it, only the
          "Help" menu appears. Why?

   7.1.9. Some new menu items are missing after updating
          Krusader, what's wrong?

   7.1.10. When I run make it complains about libfam.la
   7.1.11. Debian complains about Qt(TM) when running
          ./configure

   7.1.12. I have a libGLcore.so.1 compile error after using the
          NVIDIA installer

   7.1.13. Why Krusader-1.60.x does not compile with gcc4?
   7.1.14. I am having trouble compiling and installing Krusader,
          how do I send a help request?

   7.1.15. How can I build an RPM package for Krusader?

   7.1.1. Does Krusader need KDE to run?

   No, Krusader does not need the KDE window manager to run on
   your computer but Krusader's natural environment is KDE,
   because it relies on services provided by the KDE base
   libraries. Only some shared libraries are needed e.g. KDE
   libraries, Qt(TM) libraries, etc. This means that Krusader
   runs on GNOME, AfterStep, XFce and other window managers
   provided the approriate libraries are installed on your
   computer. All this is not a problem since the apt-get world
   can resolve these dependencies instantly.

   You don't need to switch to the KDE window manager to use
   Krusader; you can still use GNOME, AfterStep, XFce or another
   window manager. However, the configuration of the Krusader
   fonts and some behavior is done by running Kcontrol.

   A lot depends on what you would like to do with Krusader. You
   should know that Krusader uses the KDE KIOSlaves to access
   remote file systems, and support for only a limited number of
   filesystem types are shipped with KDElibs, most of the
   KIOSlaves are bundled with KDEbase (including fish, sftp and
   tar). But ... if the property-dialog should show EXIF-data for
   .jpeg's, you need KDEgraphics if you want ID3-infos, you need
   KDEmultimedia, and so on....

   To summarize, if you want a working Krusader - install
   KDElibs. If you want a functional Krusader then you need
   KDElibs + KDEbase. For maximum functionality, Krusader needs
   all of the KDE package libraries, but the KDE window manager
   is optional.

   7.1.2. Which libraries does Krusader need to run?

   For running Krusader (e.g. when you have installed Krusader
   with a binary RPM) you need less libraries than if you compile
   Krusader from source. e.g. you only need the C-compliler gcc
   when you compile Krusader from source (see the next question).

   Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of the required shared
   libraries when you run Krusader:

     * kdelibs (for the required KDE version see the Installation
       procedure) libqt3
     * libxfree86 libfreetype6 libfontconfig1
     * libjpeg62 libpng3 libmng1 zlib1 libstdc++5 libgcc1
     * libfam0 libpcre0 glibc libart_lgpl2 libexpat0 libnas2

   If you need more info please take a look at the shared library
   dependencies or the requirements on Debian .

   7.1.3. I have followed all steps but configure complains about
   missing libs or headers. What do I need to do?

   Please install them. ;-)

   Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of the required packages
   to compile Krusader from source:

     * gcc-cpp gcc-c++ glibc libgcc1 (other compilers may work
       but haven't been tested)
     * autoconf automake XFree
     * libqt3 libqt-devel
     * kdelibs kdelibs-devel
     * libjpeg62 libjpeg-devel libpng3 libmng1
     * fam libfam-devel (e.g. fam-2.x.x-xmdk.rpm and
       libfam0-devel-2.x.x-5mdk.i586.rpm)
     * zlib1 arts libart_lgpl2 libstdc++5 libpcre0
     * libkjsembed, if you use the JavaScript console, often
       found in a package called KDEbindings(-devel)

   Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers from the
   libs. The headers are needed to compile Krusader. Look for
   packages in the form foo-devel-*.rpm (e.g.
   kdelibs-devel-3.1-58mdk.i586.rpm) or foo-dev-*.deb for Debian
   based distributions. These are usua lly included with your
   distribution.

   Tip

   If you can't find the needed package, use rpmfind and click
   'missing lib or header' in the search line. Or use apt-cache
   search foo to find the corresponding package for Debian based
   distributions.

   7.1.4. How do I compile Krusader when I'm using a 64 bit
   processor ?

   Please check our user forums. We don't have much experience
   and feedback with 64 bit microprocessors yet, but we are told
   Krusader presents no unusual problems in the 64 bit
   environment.

   7.1.5. I have downloaded the Source RPM
   krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm What now?

    1. Check the ownership and the permissions on /usr/src/RPM/
       and all recursive directories, that your normal user can
       read-write-execute in these directories.
    2. To produce the binary RPM for your computer, do this:
$ rpm --rebuild </path/to/rpmfile/> krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm
    3. If all dependencies are OK, a binary RPM
       krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm will be created at
       /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586 (replace i586 with your
       architecture).
    4. Test the binary RPM for errors before installing:
$ rpm -i --test  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm
       If the prompt returns without any message, than everything
       is OK.
    5. Install the binary RPM as usual, for example:
$ su -c 'rpm -Uvh  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm'
       You will be asked to enter your root password.
    6. Now you can start Krusader.

   Tip

   For more information about RPM, take a look at the Maximum RPM
   Book. This book is very good but it dates from the year 2000,
   so some issues are obsolete/changed/improved now. If you know
   a better (or updated) RPM book on the internet please let me
   know.

   7.1.6. I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package),
   but it fails. What's wrong?

   Since we only prepare (and use) the source, we cannot know
   this. Did you test the binary RPM before installing? Corrupted
   or damaged RPM's are the typical problem. RPM's downloaded
   from our website are provided by the respective distro makers
   and are pre-tested by them. Visit your distro's website for an
   updated RPM.
$ rpm -i --test  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm

   If the prompt returns without any message, than everything is
   OK.

   If the RPM is not OK, try to find another package at Linux
   software archives such as freshmeat.net or KDE-APPS.org, DO
   NOT INSTALL A DAMAGED RPM. If you still can't find the
   appropriate package for your Linux distribution, we recommend
   searching for it with rpmfind or rpmpbone.

   In general, a package for an older version of your
   distrubution or even for another distribution might work on
   your computer (e.g. FC RPM's often work on Mdk and RH, and
   vice versa), but it is always the best that you install only
   RPM's that exactly match your distribution. If you can't find
   a package that matches your distribution version, architecture
   or distribution, then use a source RPM. When you use a source
   RPM, the Krusader sources will be built, on your computer,
   guaranteeing a suitable binary RPM for your specific
   distribution and architecture. In addition, this method
   results in maximum system speed, since the resulting binary is
   customized for your computer. Please read the previous
   question, it explains how to install a source RPM. The best
   solution is explained in the next question.

   7.1.7. I can't find a RPM or DEB package for Krusader, What
   now?

   Did you take a look at the URL's on the Installation procedure
   page? Yes, and nothing found? Then you will have to compile
   Krusader from source :) Even if you think that you have no
   skills, you will probably succeed in compiling Krusader! We
   provide a very detailed installation procedure. This HowTo
   enables newcomers to compile Krusader from source, even if
   they have never done a compilation from source before; just
   follow the instructions carefully. Feel free to post a help
   request if you encounter problems.

   7.1.8. I've installed Krusader, but when I start it, only the
   "Help" menu appears. Why?

   In this case only the Help menu is visible and all other menu
   items like e.g. File and Select are missing. This is because
   some distributions put the krusaderui.rc file in the wrong
   directory. To solve the problem, just copy the krusaderui.rc
   file from the package krusader_kde3/krusader/krusaderui.rc to
   $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc and
   ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc and re-run Krusader.
   If you have compiled Krusader from sources this is often
   caused when the KDEDIR - QTDIR environment variables are not
   correctly set. The result is that the krusaderui.rc file is
   installed in the wrong directory. Please also read the next
   question.

   7.1.9. Some new menu items are missing after updating
   Krusader, what's wrong?

   The krusaderui.rc file is stored in
   $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc. When you change the
   "Toolbar", KDE makes a copy of that file in the home directory
   at ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc. If Krusader was
   previously installed on your computer, and you install a newer
   Krusader version the ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc
   file must be replaced with the newer version.

   The first line of krusaderui.rc contains the version number.
   After installing a newer Krusader version, KDE will
   automatically replace the old
   ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc with the newer
   version when starting the new Krusader for the first time (KDE
   will detect the newer version number in the first line).

   If you install a CVS or beta version and Krusader was already
   installed on your computer then you should delete the
   krusaderui.rc file in your home directory to activate the new
   menu entries $ rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc

   If the ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc file is older,
   then the new menu elements will not be shown. Read the
   previous question for information on how to update the
   krusaderui.rc file. If krusaderui.rc is missing or in a wrong
   directory, only the "Help" menu appears, please read the
   previous question.

   7.1.10. When I run make it complains about libfam.la

   The ./configure script does not check for the presence of
   libfam.la, and make needs libfam.la to compile Krusader. If
   you know how this can be solved, please let us know. Install
   libfam0-devel-foo.rpm. Note: when you install
   Mandrake(TM)-Linux 9.2 with the default settings, this
   package is not installed. If you need more information take a
   look at FAQ missing libs or headers.

   7.1.11. Debian complains about Qt(TM) when running
   ./configure

   This problem occurs when you use gcc 2.95, you need to install
   gcc 3.2 (or higher). You also need to set the enviroment
   variables "CC, CPP and CXX" before running the ./configure
   script.
$ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.2
$ export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-3.2
$ export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp-3.2

   For more information please take a look in our forum and at
   the instructions on how to build a Qt(TM)/KDE3 application on
   Debian.

   7.1.12. I have a libGLcore.so.1 compile error after using the
   NVIDIA installer

   This problem occurs when you use the NVIDIA installer and not
   the official NVIDIA packages of your distribution. Krusader
   is based on Qt(TM) which can be linked against the X OpenGL
   libraries. As a result Krusader may look for OpenGL as well.
   The problem is that the NVIDIA installer (prior to version
   7xxx) doesn't do its job properly, it replaces the OpenGL
   header files (which get included into Krusader) but doesn't
   set the libGL links correctly. The best solution is to use the
   NVIDIA packages provided by your distributor or a new NVIDIA
   installer, the current version is 7114. If, for some reason,
   you must use an old NVIDIA driver, one solution is the
   following (bad? :) hack, the exact commands depend on the
   distribution used and the version of the NVIDIA driver (6111
   in this example), but it should read something like this:
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.1.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.0.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so 
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.0.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.1
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.1.0.0
$ ln -s  /usr/lib/libGLU.la   /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.la

   7.1.13. Why Krusader-1.60.x does not compile with gcc4?

   Because Krusader-1.60.x was not gcc4 compatible, it needs
   first some patches:

     * add 'class ListPanelFunc;' in krusader/Panel/listpanel.h
     * add 'class KMountManGUI;' in krusader/MountMan/kmountman.h
     * add 'class KrDetailedViewItem;' in
       krusader/Panel/krdetailedview.h

   More information can be found in our forum .

   7.1.14. I am having trouble compiling and installing Krusader,
   how do I send a help request?

   Please read our detailed installation procedure and the FAQ.
   If you can't find a solution to your problem then feel free to
   post a help request at our Krusader forum. But before posting
   a help request at our Krusader forum, please try the
   following:

    1. Use the Search function of the Krusader Forum , your
       problem might be solved or discussed already.
    2. If you can't find a solution, please make a note of the
       following issues:
          + the Krusader version used
          + the Linux distribution + version used
          + a good description of the problem
       Without this information, it is very difficult for us to
       help you.

   Note

   If you give us the error messages (e.g. make error messages)
   please start with the FIRST error message, all the error
   messages who are following the first error message are
   consequences and not the cause of your problem.
    3. Post a help request with the information of the previous
       point at our General Discussion Forum.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   7.1.15. How can I build an RPM package for Krusader?

   If you have experience with compiling from source, you will
   probably be able to build a Krusader RPM too. Follow the next
   steps to build an RPM.

   Warning

   Never, ever build RPMs when logged in as root. Mistakes in
   building packages (e.g. a bad krusader.spec file) can do
   serious damage to your system, when logged in as root.

    1. Compile Krusader from source to check that the compilation
       works fine.
    2. Check the ownership and the permissions on /usr/src/RPM/
       and all recursive directories, that your normal user can
       read-write-execute in these directories.
    3. Copy kusader1.xx.tar.gz to /usr/scr/RPM/SOURCE
    4. Copy kusader.spec to /usr/scr/RPM/SPECS Tip: the latest
       kusader.spec can be found in CVS.
    5. Edit kusader.spec and add your name, your e-mail address,
       the rpm name, ... (please read the comments in
       kusader.spec). Other changes may be needed if rpmbuild
       fails.
    6. Build the binary and the source RPM with:
$ rpmbuild -ba /usr/scr/RPM/SPECS/krusader.spec
       If everything went OK you will have a binary RPM in
       /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586 (depending on your architecture)
       and a sourceRPM in /usr/src/RPM/SRPMS/ e.g.
       krusader-1.50-beta1.suse91.i586.rpm and
       krusader-1.50-beta1.suse91.src.rpm
    7. If the build is not OK you will receive an error message
       during the rpmbuild process, try to fix it and re-run
       rpmbuild again.
    8. And finally: test the RPM before sending it in.

7.2. Usage FAQ

   7.2.1. Why does Krusader crash?
   7.2.2. When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader
          says something about supermount, what's this about?

   7.2.3. Why does Krusader freeze or hang on a dead mountpoint?
   7.2.4. When I try to resize Krusader, so that it's smaller, I
          discover that I can't resize it below a certain size.
          Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?

   7.2.5. When I do some file operation, and Krusader's panel
          doesn't refresh / I'm using Krusader with fam
          installed, but updates to the panel are not shown.

   7.2.6. Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / what to do if Krusader does
          not read shared directories containing special
          international characters?

   7.2.7. Krusader reports "krarc:... protocol not supported"
          error at opening an archive file.

   7.2.8. Why have i trouble with my FTP connection?
   7.2.9. I get "FTP protocol not supported by Krusader" error at
          trying to open a remote FTP directory.

   7.2.10. How can i close a remote connection (e.g. a FTP
          connection) ?

   7.2.11. Why do i have some trouble with the media:// protocol?
   7.2.12. How can I disable the default sounds e.g. when I do a
          delete action ?

          Krusader: "krarc:/path/to/foo-archive", when I try to
          open foo-Archive

   7.2.14. Where is RemoteMan, the remote connection manager ?
   7.2.15. Why mimetype magic isn't sometimes working inside
          archives?

   7.2.16. Why does the handbook not work?

   7.2.1. Why does Krusader crash?

   We've been getting a lot of emails and bug reports regarding
   random crashes in Krusader, especially during some file
   operations (copy/move etc.). These crashes are related to
   Qt(TM) 3.3.5 and NOT Krusader. It seems that Qt(TM) 3.3.5
   introduced a serious bug which is currently (December 2005)
   causing random crashes in many KDE applications including
   Konqueror. You can Google for it to find out more. As far as
   we know, Debian-Sid and SuSE already posted new Qt(TM)
   binaries that fix the problem, and Gentoo has masked Qt(TM)
   3.3.5 completely. As for now, you either need Qt(TM) 3.3.4 or
   a fixed Qt(TM) 3.3.5, depending on your distribution. More
   information is available on our website.

   7.2.2. When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader
   says something about supermount, what's this about?

   Supermount is a daemon which handles the mounting/unmounting
   of removable filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and do
   cd /mnt/floppy
   supermount will do the mount for you automatically and
   transparently. All this is great, however, supermount misleads
   the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is mounted at
   all times! This creates some problems for Krusader, as it
   cannot really know when the floppy or CD has been removed
   because the system information is not correctly updated by
   supermount - is there really a floppy in the drive? Of course,
   this can be solved, but as for now, we don't consider it a
   priority. Feel free to write a patch for it ;-).

   7.2.3. Why does Krusader freeze or hang on a dead mountpoint?

   When Krusader is e.g. browsing a NFS share and the NFS server
   goes down, then Krusader will freeze. This Krusader (and all
   other open internal viewers/editors) freeze is fatal, and can
   only be corrected with the kill -9. We have no solution to
   offer here. This is an issue not confined to file managers, or
   even the Linux OS! The problem is that you "hang" on the
   first access to the dead share - so there is no way around it,
   no check to avoid it, even ls will freeze. Just trying to read
   something - anything - is enough to get you stuck. The one and
   only way around this architectural problem is using a
   multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck, we don't
   hang the entire application event loop, but we don't think
   that the time is right for adding threads, we are not sure
   that *all* the KDE systems out there are using Qt(TM)-mt (the
   multi threaded version of the Qt(TM) library), and the
   Krusader Krew may not be the right people to address this
   major issue in any case; so currently this is just a bug we
   have to learn to live with.

   7.2.4. When I try to resize Krusader, so that it's smaller, I
   discover that I can't resize it below a certain size.
   Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?

   See the F1, F2 (etc.) buttons? They are not allowing Krusader
   to downsize as they have a minimum size. Just disable them
   View->Show FN Keys Bar and you'll be able to resize Krusader
   to your liking. Since version 1.51 we have improved this a
   lot: when downsizing the buttons will look like 'F5 ..py'.
   When the button faces are too small to read a tooltip will
   give the complete text. The minimum width is 45 pixels for
   each button.

   7.2.5. When I do some file operation, and Krusader's panel
   doesn't refresh / I'm using Krusader with fam installed, but
   updates to the panel are not shown.

   The bad news is that we're not sure why, but it seems that fam
   (file alteration monitor) sometimes refuses to work. We are
   looking into this problem to make sure it is not our problem.
   We've tried the same source code on two different Gentoo
   installations: one worked, the other did not. The good news is
   that if you disable fam, Krusader will automatically revert to
   its internal update mechanism (which is less efficient, but
   works) without needing to recompile. You can disable fam with:
$ su -c 'fam -l'

   Look at the manpages for more information about fam.

   7.2.6. Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / what to do if Krusader does
   not read shared directories containing special international
   characters?

   Krusader does not handle (yet) Samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if
   you use a codepage different than 8859-1 you will have to do a
   manual configuration. Create or modify the file:
   ~/.smb/smb.conf
   [global]
   workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
   client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
   character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)

   Unfortunately kcontrol (KDE 3.1.1) fails to configure smb.conf
   properly, so this must be done manually with a text editor.

   7.2.7. Krusader reports "krarc:... protocol not supported"
   error at opening an archive file.

   Solution: install the krarc slave properly:

   Copy the kio_krarc.so, kio_krarc.la files into
   $KDEDIR/lib/kde3

   Copy the krarc.protocol file into $KDEDIR/share/services

   or the directory where the KIO slaves are placed in your
   Linux distribution.

   7.2.8. Why have i trouble with my FTP connection?

   This problem often occurs when you are behind a firewall or
   proxy. Open KDE Control Center->Network->Preferences , "Enable
   Passive Mode (PASV)" has to be turned on or off, depending on
   it's current setting. Now try your FTP session again to see if
   it works. Also, make sure you have no other FTP sessions open
   (using web browsers, etc.), they might cause some trouble.
   More information information can be found in Active FTP vs.
   Passive FTP, a Definitive Explanation .

   7.2.9. I get "FTP protocol not supported by Krusader" error at
   trying to open a remote FTP directory.

   The reason for this error is that 'FTP via HTTP proxy' feature
   is not yet supported by Krusader. This error can occur from
   the misconfiguring of the proxy settings in KDE Control
   Center. Modify the proxy settings to not use HTTP proxy and
   FTP will work.

   7.2.10. How can i close a remote connection (e.g. a FTP
   connection) ?

   It's explained in the remote connections chapter .

   7.2.11. Why do i have some trouble with the media:// protocol?

   At the moment of writing the media:// protocol is instable, we
   need to wait until the KDE team corrects it, every other
   protocol works properly with Krusader, only media fails. More
   information regarding this issue is available in our forum .

   7.2.12. How can I disable the default sounds e.g. when I do a
   delete action ?

   Those are the default KDE System sounds, and not related to
   Krusader. If you want to disable them globally open your KDE
   KDE Control Center (kcontrol): KDE Control Center->Sound &
   Multimedia->System Notifications , Event Source: "KDE System
   Notifications" and uncheck sound items you don't like.

   7.2.13. I get the error message "Protocol not supported by
   Krusader: "krarc:/path/to/foo-archive", when I try to open
   foo-Archive

   The icons, kio_slaves and documentation must be installed in
   the correct places in the KDE directory tree. The kio_krarc.*
   files must be in the same directory with the other KIO slaves.
   Try: locate kio_tar.* and copy/link the kio_krarc.* files to
   the same location. Don't forget to run # ldconfig on this
   directory when you're done. This problem can sometimes occur
   if you are using a 64 bit microprocessor. For more information
   click here .

   7.2.14. Where is RemoteMan, the remote connection manager ?

   RemoteMan has been replaced by our Bookmark Manager since
   Krusader 1.25-beta1. The Bookmark Manager handles local files
   and remote URL's the same way. RemoteMan was left as a
   selection until Krusader-1.51 to allow an easier transition
   and give you a chance to move your Bookmarks. RemoteMan was
   disabled, as announced, in Krusader-1.60.

   URL transition procedure:

    1. install Krusader-1.51
    2. open the RemoteMan and connect to an FTP
    3. once inside, bookmark the current location, select a name
       and save.
    4. do this for all your connections, all the Bookmarks are
       now stored in krbookmarks.xml
    5. install Krusader-1.60, it will use krbookmarks.xml or
       import it if needed.

   7.2.15. Why mimetype magic isn't sometimes working inside
   archives?

   When you enter an archive and press F3 to view a file that has
   no known extension, e.g. README, INSTALL etc.. And if the
   viewer opens in hex-mode instead of the usual mode, than you
   need to configure: KDE Control Center->KDE components->File
   Associations->Application->octet-stream, binary viewer needs
   to be removed.

   7.2.16. Why does the handbook not work?

   This error will happen on Debian (or Debian based) distro
   with the krusader_1.51-1_i386.deb package. You will see the
   next error message if you try to open the handbook: "The
   requested help file could not be found. Check that you have
   installed the documentation." To fix it go to
   /usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/en/krusader/, you will see the
   foo.docbook.gz files. Now, you need to extract all these files
   with root priveleges ("File->Unpack" with Krusader) to create
   foo.docbook files. Now the handbook will work. This error is
   fixed in the krusader_1.60.0-1_i386.deb package and higher
   numbers.

   7.3.1. How can I report a wish, a patch, a suggestion, or a
   comment?

   An open source project's greatest strength is derived from
   getting user feedback. That is why we love to hear what you
   have to say. Your "Gripes" are our instructions. After about 6
   months, programmers can no longer see their own mistakes. It's
   natural. We want the ideas, xritiques, and feedback because we
   all want to make Krusader the best, most useful, file manager
   available anywhere.

   If you like to send in a patch, please discuss it first with
   Shie Erlich before writing a patch. Sometimes we can't apply a
   patch if the patch is in conflict with the "general design" of
   the code, this would be very pity and a waste of your precious
   time.

   The most convenient way to contact us is to use the Krusader
   Forum, or by mail. For information on what remains to be done
   look at the ToDo Forum. Adding ToDo items into the ToDo Forum
   is for developers only, but feel free to post to the New
   Features Discussion/Requests Forum for things that aren't on
   the ToDo Forum, but should be. If you have a nice feature
   request, the Krusader Krew will add your request to the ToDo
   Forum. We review and discuss every submission. For more
   information how the forum works click here .

   7.3.2. How can I report a bug?

   Bugs?!?!? Well, ok.... We have an online Bug Tracking System.

   Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly
   way to know how many bugs are open, bug priority and
   follow-ups. It saves us the long time needed to browse the
   entire Krusader forum, searching for yesterdays bug. Please
   use this system.

   Before reporting a bug, please read the following:

    1. Use the Search function of the Krusader Forum , your bug
       might be solved already. Please DO NOT post new bugs to
       the Bug Discussion Forum (except if you are not sure that
       you have found a bug). We use it for bug discussions.
    2. Check if the bug is already posted in the online bug list
       of the Bug Tracking System.
    3. If you can't find this bug mentioned, please submit it
       into the bug tracker by clicking the Submit New button in
       the bug-tracker window. Please submit the following
       issues: the Krusader version used, the Linux distribution
       + version used, processor type, and as good a description
       of the problem as you can manage.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   Note

   If possible, try to do the same operation with Konqueror or
   another KDE application. If you encounter the same problem
   then it is possibly a KIOSlaves or KDE (kdelibs) bug, and not
   a Krusader bug. Krusader uses the KDE libraries and the
   KIOSlaves for many operations. In some cases you can encounter
   problems if your distribution is incorrectly configured,
   please test it first as explained above, thanks!

   Note

   7.3.3. Does Krusader have a mailing list?

   Yes, currently have 6 mailing lists. No spam, no bother, just
   Krusader. Feel free to (un)subscribe.

   Tip. our mailing lists can be browsed online or read with a
   newsreader, so that you don't even need to subscribe to follow
   the action on the mailing lists.

     * Krusader-news is a very low volume list, used for
       newsletters and announcements of new versions or critical
       bugfixes. The news can also been read online at latest
       news and in the News and Announcements Forum which are
       basically the same but displayed in another format.
     * Krusader-devel is the developer mailing list (read-only).
       If you want to follow the development of Krusader on the
       bleeding edge, this is the place to be!
     * Krusader-users is the Krusader users mailing list. Here
       you can ask help and talk with the Krusader users and
       developers.
     * Krusader-i18n is the translations mailing list.
     * Krusader-doc is the documentation mailing list.
     * Krusader-commits (read-only) when the Krusader Krew
       commits code into CVS, it will be reported in this mailing
       list. This allows you to follow the Krusader development
       ... live! Want to keep track? Waiting for a certain
       feature/bugfix?

   7.3.4. Does Krusader provides newsfeeds?

   Yes, we do. Several newsfeeds in various formats are
   available. rss-filerelease feed, rss-forumfeed, krusader-news
   feed, krusader-devel feed and even additional feeds by
   gmane.org. krusader-users feed, krusader-i18n feed,
   krusader-doc feed.

   7.3.5. Does Krusader have a IRC channel?

   Yes, we have. Feel free to talk to the Krusader Krew, and of
   course fellow-users via freenode.org servers. The server is
   irc.freenode.org, the channel is #krusader. Everyone is
   welcome.

   7.3.6. How does the Krusader forum work?

   In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that is
   Krusader related can be discussed in our forum. It does not
   matter that you are a newcomer or an advanced user, everybody
   is welcome. An open source project's greatest strength is
   derived from getting user feedback. That is why we love to
   hear what you have to say. With your feedback we can make
   Krusader better and better; otherwise, we are not aware of
   issues and ideas you may have. But please remember the
   following, so that we can maintain some order in the chaos.
   ;-)

   If the Documentation, FAQ, Krusader Forum and Krusader-devel
   (please use the search function ) can't help you, do not
   hesitate to drop a note to our forum. The Krusader Krew or the
   Krusader community is always available to help you.

   Please use the Search function of the Krusader Forum, your
   issue may have been previously discussed (this allows us to
   minimze the double/triple/... postings). If your issue has
   already been discussed in the past there is a great chance
   that you will have an instant solution for your issue/problem.
   If the issue is currently being discussed, you can join in the
   discussion. Some questions are asked over and over again, for
   these we have made the FAQ ;-) This also allows us also to
   spend more time in developing Krusader.

   The Krusader Forum is split into six sections:

     * News and Announcements Forum all the latest news.
     * Bug Discussion Forum: discussions about bugs, please DO
       NOT use the forum for bug reports (except if you are
       unsure if you have found a bug).
     * New Features Discussion/Requests Forum: discussions about
       new features for future Krusader versions.
     * ToDo Forum here you will find the list of the planned
       features. Registered users will be able to VOTE and
       COMMENT on the TODO items. Here you get the chance to push
       your favourite features (+3) and still prefer certain
       features over others (+1), if you don't care about a
       feature just simply don't vote on that feature.
       Unregistered users may only browse the ToDo Forum. The
       ToDo ranking system contains the results based on the
       votes. Adding ToDo items or removing ToDo items which have
       been implemented will be done by the Krusader Krew.
     * UserActions Forum discussions about UserActions. Posting
       your own User Actions is greatly appreciated. We plan to
       include the best ones in the next Krusader releases.
     * General Discussion Forum: everything that is Krusader
       related and doesn't belong in the other forums.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   We are providing RSS feeds for our forums. You don't have to
   check for new posts all the time, instead the news will come
   to you! To make use of them, simply point your RSS aggregator
   to here.

   7.3.7. How can I translate Krusader to my native language?

   Please read the i18n page. It's not difficult to translate!
   Most anyone can do it, it just takes some time.

   7.3.8. How can I support Krusader?

   You can support Krusader in many different ways: please send
   us feedback, bug reports, patches, donations, translations,
   ...

   7.3.9. Is there a Mac OS X port?

   Yes, there is Mac OS X port, but you will not have (yet) the
   all the power like on Linux. Please read the Mac OS X port
   section for more information. A recommended native file
   manager for Mac OS is Disk Order (shareware).

   7.3.10. Is there a Windows port?

   No, but this might change in the future. Please help us,
   thanks. A recommended native file manager for Windows is
   Total Commander (shareware).
