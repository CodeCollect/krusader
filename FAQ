Chapter 7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

   If you have problems with Krusader please check the
   Installation procedure, your problem may be due to a bad
   installation.

   The FAQ is divided into three sections:

     * Installation FAQ (this page)
     * Usage FAQ (issues when running/using Krusader)
     * General FAQ (bug reports, forum, mailing list, ...)

   If you have the feeling that a FAQ is missing or if something
   is not clear to you, please let us know.
     _________________________________________________________

7.1. Installation FAQ

   7.1.1. Does Krusader need KDE to run?
   7.1.2. Which libraries does Krusader need to run?
   7.1.3. I have followed all steps but configure complains about
          missing libs or headers. What do I need to do?

   7.1.4. How do I compile Krusader when I'm using a 64 bit
          processor ?

   7.1.5. I have downloaded the Source RPM
          krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm What now?

   7.1.6. I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package),
          but it fails. What's wrong?

   7.1.7. I can't find a RPM or DEB package for Krusader, What
          now?

   7.1.8. I've installed Krusader, but when I start it, only the
          "Help" menu appears. Why?

   7.1.9. Some new menu items are missing after updating
          Krusader, what's wrong?

   7.1.10. When I run make it complains about libfam.la
   7.1.11. Debian® complains about Qt(TM) when running
          ./configure

   7.1.12. I have a libGLcore.so.1 compile error after using the
          NVIDIA® installer

   7.1.13. I am having trouble compiling and installing Krusader,
          how do I send a help request?

   7.1.14. How can I build an RPM package for Krusader?

   7.1.1. Does Krusader need KDE to run?

   No, Krusader does not need the KDE window manager to run on
   your computer but Krusader's natural environment is KDE,
   because it relies on services provided by the KDE base
   libraries. Only some shared libraries are needed e.g. KDE
   libraries, Qt(TM) libraries, etc. This means that Krusader
   runs on GNOME, AfterStep and other window managers if the
   approriate packages are installed on your computer.

   You don't need to switch to KDE; you can still use GNOME or
   another window manager. btw, you can configure the menu font
   by running kcontrol.

   But a lot depends on what you would like to do with Krusader.
   You should know that Krusader uses the KDE KIOSlaves to access
   remote file systems, and only a limited number of slaves (bad
   choice of words: slaves) are shipped with KDElibs, most of the
   KIOSlaves are bundled with KDEbase (including fish, sftp and
   tar). But ... if the property-dialog should show EXIF-data for
   .jpeg's, you need KDEgraphics if you want ID3-infos, you need
   KDEmultimedia, and so on....

   To summarize, if you want a working Krusader - install
   KDElibs. If you want a functional Krusader then you need
   KDElibs + KDEbase. If you need more functionality, then
   Krusader needs some more KDE packages.

   7.1.2. Which libraries does Krusader need to run?

   For running Krusader (e.g. when you have installed Krusader
   with a binary RPM) you need less libraries or packages as
   mentioned in the next question, e.g. you don't need the
   C-compliler gcc it's only needed when you compile Krusader
   from source.

   Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of the required shared
   libraries when you run Krusader:

     * kdelibs >= 3.2 libqt3
     * libxfree86 libfreetype6 libfontconfig1
     * libjpeg62 libpng3 libmng1 zlib1 libstdc++5 libgcc1
     * libfam0 libpcre0 glibc libart_lgpl2 libexpat0 libnas2

   A complete list of shared library dependencies is available.

   7.1.3. I have followed all steps but configure complains about
   missing libs or headers. What do I need to do?

   Please install them. ;-)

   Here is a (possibly incomplete) list of the required packages
   to compile Krusader from source:

     * gcc-cpp gcc-c++ glibc libgcc1 (other compilers may work
       but haven't been tested)
     * autoconf automake XFree
     * libqt3 libqt-devel (Krusader v1.50 needs Qt(TM) 3.x)
     * kdelibs kdelibs-devel (Krusader v1.50 needs KDElibs >=
       3.2.x)
     * libjpeg62 libjpeg-devel libpng3 libmng1
     * fam libfam-devel (e.g. fam-2.x.x-xmdk.rpm and
       libfam0-devel-2.x.x-5mdk.i586.rpm)
     * zlib1 arts libart_lgpl2 libstdc++5 libpcre0
     * libkjsembed, if you use the JavaScript console, often
       found in a package called KDEbindings(-devel)

   Most RPM-based distributions separate the headers from the
   libs. The headers are needed to compile Krusader. Look for
   packages in the form foo-devel-*.rpm (e.g.
   kdelibs-devel-3.1-58mdk.i586.rpm) or foo-dev-*.deb for Debian®
   based distributions. They most likely come with your
   distribution.

   Tip

   If you can't find the needed package, use the rpmfind.net and
   click 'missing lib or header' in the search line. Or use
   apt-cache search foo to find the corresponding package for
   Debian® based distributions.

   7.1.4. How do I compile Krusader when I'm using a 64 bit
   processor ?

   Please look and search in our forums. We don't have much
   experience and feedback with 64 bit microprocessors yet.

   7.1.5. I have downloaded the Source RPM
   krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm What now?

    1. Check the ownership and the permissions on /usr/src/RPM/
       and all recursive directories, that your normal user can
       read-write-execute in these directories.
    2. To produce the binary RPM for your computer, do this:
$ rpm --rebuild </path/to/rpmfile/> krusader-x.xx.dist.src.rpm
    3. If all dependencies are OK, a binary RPM
       krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm will be created at
       /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586 (replace i586 with your
       architecture).
    4. Test the binary RPM before installing:
$ rpm -i --test  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm
       If the prompt returns without any message, than everything
       is OK.
    5. Install the binary RPM as usual, for example:
$ su -c 'rpm -Uvh  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm'
       You will be asked to enter your root password.
    6. Now you can start Krusader.

   Tip

   For more information about RPM, take a look at the Maximum RPM
   Book. This book is very good but it dates from the year 2000,
   so some issues are obsolete/changed/improved now. If you know
   a better (or updated) RPM book on the internet please let me
   know.

   7.1.6. I'm trying to install binary foo (RPM or DEB package),
   but it fails. What's wrong?

   Since we only provide (and use) the source, we don't know.
   Please test the binary RPM before installing:
$ rpm -i --test  </path/to/rpmfile> krusader-x.xx.dist.rpm

   If the prompt returns without any message, than everything is
   OK.

   If it is not OK, try to find another package at Linux®
   software archives such as freshmeat.net or KDE-APPS.org. If
   you still can't find a package for your Linux® distribution,
   we recommend searching for it with rpmfind.net or
   rpmpbone.net.

   In general, a package for an older version of your
   distrubution or even for an other distribution might work on
   your computer, but it is always the best that it matches your
   distribution. If you can't find a package that matches your
   distribution version, architecture or distribution, then use a
   source RPM. When you use a source RPM, the Krusader sources
   will be build, on your computer, a suitable binary RPM for
   your distribution and architecture. Please read the previous
   question, it explains how to install a source RPM. The best
   solution is explained in the next question.

   7.1.7. I can't find a RPM or DEB package for Krusader, What
   now?

   Did you take a look at the URL's on the Installation procedure
   page? Yes, and nothing found? Then you will have to compile
   Krusader from source :) Even if you think that you have no
   skills, you will probably succeed in compiling Krusader! We
   provide a very detailed installation procedure. This HowTo
   intends that newcomers will be able to compile Krusader from
   source, even if they have never done a compilation from source
   before. Feel free to post a help request if you encounter
   problems.

   7.1.8. I've installed Krusader, but when I start it, only the
   "Help" menu appears. Why?

   In this case only the Help menu is visible and all other menu
   items like e.g. File and Select are missing. This is because
   some distributions put the krusaderui.rc file in the wrong
   directory. To solve the problem, just copy the krusaderui.rc
   file from the package krusader_kde3/krusader/krusaderui.rc to
   $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc and
   ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc and re-run Krusader.
   If you have compiled Krusader from sources this is often
   caused when the KDEDIR - QTDIR environment variables are not
   correctly set. The result is that the krusaderui.rc file is
   installed in the wrong directory. Please also read the next
   question.

   7.1.9. Some new menu items are missing after updating
   Krusader, what's wrong?

   The krusaderui.rc file is stored in
   $KDEDIR/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc. When you change the
   "Toolbar", KDE makes a copy of that file in the home directory
   at ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc. If Krusader was
   previously installed on your computer, and you install a newer
   Krusader version the ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc
   file must be replaced with the newer version.

   The first line of krusaderui.rc contains the version number.
   After installing a newer Krusader stable version, KDE will
   automatically replace the old
   ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc with the newer
   version when starting the new Krusader stable for the first
   time (KDE will detect the newer version number in the first
   line). In the past this was not the case due to a bug, this
   bug was resolved since "krusader-cvs-2004-02-24".

   If you install a CVS or beta version and if Krusader was
   previously installed on your computer then you should delete
   the krusaderui.rc file in your home directory to activate the
   new menu entries $ rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc

   If the ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc file is older,
   then the new menu elements will not be shown. Read the
   previous question for information on how to update the
   krusaderui.rc file. If krusaderui.rc is missing or in a wrong
   directory, only the "Help" menu appears, please read the
   previous question.

   7.1.10. When I run make it complains about libfam.la

   The ./configure script does not check for the presence of
   libfam.la, and make needs libfam.la to compile Krusader. If
   you know how this can be solved, please let us know. Install
   libfam0-devel-foo.rpm. Note: when you install
   Mandrake(TM)-Linux® 9.2 with the default settings, this
   package is not installed. If you need more information take a
   look at FAQ missing libs or headers.

   7.1.11. Debian® complains about Qt(TM) when running
   ./configure

   This problem occurs when you use gcc 2.95, you will need to
   install gcc 3.2 (or higher). You need also set the enviroment
   variables "CC, CPP and CXX" before running the ./configure
   script.
$ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.2
$ export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-3.2
$ export CPP=/usr/bin/cpp-3.2

   For more information please take a look in our forum and at
   the instructions on how to build a Qt(TM)/KDE3 application on
   Debian®.

   7.1.12. I have a libGLcore.so.1 compile error after using the
   NVIDIA® installer

   This problem occurs when you use the NVIDIA® installer and not
   the official NVIDIA® packages of your distribution. Krusader
   is based on Qt(TM) which can be linked against the X OpenGL
   libraries. As a result Krusader may look for OpenGL as well.
   The problem is that the NVIDIA® installer doesn't do its job
   properly, it replaces the OpenGL header files (which get
   included into Krusader) but doesn't set the libGL links
   correctly. The best solution is to use the NVIDIA® packages
   provided by your distributor. The second solution is a (bad?
   :) hack, and also the exact commands depends on the used
   distribution and the version of the NVIDIA® driver (6111 in
   this example), but it should be something like this:
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.1.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGLcore.so.0.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so 
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.0.0.0
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.1
$ ln -s libGLcore.so.1.0.6111  libGL.so.1.0.0
$ ln -s  /usr/lib/libGLU.la   /usr/X11R6/lib/libGLU.la

   7.1.13. I am having trouble compiling and installing Krusader,
   how do I send a help request?

   Please read our detailed installation procedure and the FAQ.
   If you can't find a solution to your problem then feel free to
   post a help request at our Krusader forum. But before posting
   a help request at our Krusader forum, please regard the
   following:

    1. Use the Search function of the Krusader Forum , your
       problem might be solved or discussed already.
    2. If you can't find a solution, please make a note of the
       following issues:
          + the Krusader version used
          + the Linux® distribution + version used
          + a good description of the problem
       Without this information, it is very difficult for us to
       help you.

   Note

   If you give us the error messages (e.g. make error messages)
   please start with the FIRST error message, all the error
   messages who are following the first error message are
   consequences and not the cause of your problem.
    3. Post a help request with the information of the previous
       point at our General Discussion Forum.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   7.1.14. How can I build an RPM package for Krusader?

   If you have experience with compiling from source, you will
   probably be able to build a Krusader RPM too. Follow the next
   steps to build an RPM.

   Warning

   Never, ever build RPMs when logged in as root. Mistakes in
   building packages (e.g. a bad krusader.spec file) can do
   serious damage to your system, when logged in as root.

    1. Compile Krusader from source to check that the compilation
       works fine.
    2. Check the ownership and the permissions on /usr/src/RPM/
       and all recursive directories, that your normal user can
       read-write-execute in these directories.
    3. Copy kusader1.xx.tar.gz to /usr/scr/RPM/SOURCE
    4. Copy kusader.spec to /usr/scr/RPM/SPECS Tip: the latest
       kusader.spec can be found in CVS.
    5. Edit kusader.spec and add your name, your e-mail address,
       the rpm name, ... (please read the comments in
       kusader.spec). Other changes may be needed if rpmbuild
       fails.
    6. Build the binary and the source RPM with:
$ rpmbuild -ba /usr/scr/RPM/SPECS/krusader.spec
       If everything went OK you will have a binaryRPM in
       /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/i586 (depending on your architecture)
       and a sourceRPM in /usr/src/RPM/SRPMS/ e.g.
       krusader-1.50-beta1.suse91.i586.rpm and
       krusader-1.50-beta1.suse91.src.rpm
    7. If it is not OK you will receive an error message during
       the rpmbuild process, try to fix it and re-run rpmbuild
       again.
    8. And finally: test the RPM before sending it in.

7.2. Usage FAQ

   7.2.1. When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader
          says something about supermount, what's this about?

   7.2.2. Why does Krusader freezes on a dead mountpoint?
   7.2.3. When I try to resize Krusader, so that it's smaller, I
          discover that I can't resize it below a certain size.
          Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?

   7.2.4. When I do some file operation, Krusader's panel doesn't
          refresh / I'm using Krusader with fam installed, but
          updates to the panel are not shown.

   7.2.5. Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / what to do if Krusader does
          not read shared directories containing national
          characters?

   7.2.6. Krusader reports "krarc:... protocol not supported"
          error at opening an archive file.

   7.2.7. When I try to establish an FTP connection, I get an
          error message after 'Connect OK' saying 'Could not
          connect to host'.

   7.2.8. I get "FTP protocol not supported by Krusader" error at
          trying to open a remote FTP directory.

   7.2.9. How can I disable the default sounds e.g. when I do a
          delete action ?

   7.2.10. I get the error message "Protocol not supported by
          Krusader: "krarc:/path/to/foo-archive", when I try to
          open foo-Archive

   7.2.11. Where is RemoteMan, the remote connection manager ?

   7.2.1. When I try to mount/unmount my cdrom/floppy, Krusader
   says something about supermount, what's this about?

   Supermount is a daemon which handles mounting/unmounting of
   removable filesystems for you. Just insert a floppy, and do cd
   /mnt/floppy
   supermount will do the mount for you automatically and
   transparently. All this is great, however, supermount
   manipulates the system into thinking that the floppy/cdrom is
   mounted at all times! This creates a few problems for
   Krusader, as it can't really know what's going on - is there
   really a floppy in the drive? Of course, this can be solved,
   but as for now, we don't consider it a priority. Feel free to
   write a patch for it ;-).

   7.2.2. Why does Krusader freezes on a dead mountpoint?

   When Krusader is e.g. browsing a NFS share and the NFS server
   goes down, then Krusader will freeze. Krusader (including all
   open internal viewers/editors) freeze and can only be killed
   with kill -9. We have no solution for it in short term. The
   problem is that you "hang" on the first access to the dead
   share - so there is no way around it, no check to avoid it,
   even ls will freeze. Just trying to read something - anything
   - is enough to get you stuck. The one and only way around is
   using a multi-threaded design - this way if we get stuck, we
   don't hang the entire application event loop, but we don't
   think that the time is right for adding threads, we are not
   sure that *all* the KDE system out there are using Qt(TM)-mt
   (the multi threaded version of the Qt(TM) library) so
   currently it's a bug we have to learn to live with.

   7.2.3. When I try to resize Krusader, so that it's smaller, I
   discover that I can't resize it below a certain size.
   Basically, it doesn't get much smaller. Why?

   See the F1, F2 (etc.) buttons? They are not allowing Krusader
   to downsize as they have a minimum size. Just disable them
   View->Show FN Keys Bar and you'll be able to resize Krusader
   to your liking. Since version 1.51 we have improved this a lot
   better: when downsizing the buttons will look like 'F5 ..py',
   a tooltip will give the complete text. The minimum is 45 for
   pixels each button, that should give a minimum width of about
   500 pixels and seems reasonable to us.

   7.2.4. When I do some file operation, Krusader's panel doesn't
   refresh / I'm using Krusader with fam installed, but updates
   to the panel are not shown.

   The bad news is that we're not sure why, but it seems that fam
   (file alteration monitor) sometimes refuses to work. Feel free
   to write a patch for it ;-). We've tried the same source code
   on two different Gentoo installation: one worked, the other
   did not. The good news is that if you disable fam, Krusader
   will automatically revert to its internal mechanism (which is
   less efficient, but works) without needing to recompile. You
   can disable fam with:
$ su -c 'fam -l'

   Look at the manpages for more information about fam.

   7.2.5. Samba ISO 8859-x codepage / what to do if Krusader does
   not read shared directories containing national characters?

   Krusader does not handle (yet) Samba ISO 8859-x codepages, if
   you use a codepage different than 8859-1 you will have to do a
   manual configuration. Create or modify the file:
   ~/.smb/smb.conf
   [global]
   workgroup = MyWorkGroup       (ex. WORKGROUP)
   client code page = MyCodePage (ex. 852)
   character set = MyCharSet     (ex. ISO8859-2)

   Unfortunately kcontrol (KDE 3.1.1) fails to configure it
   properly, so this step must be done with a text editor.

   7.2.6. Krusader reports "krarc:... protocol not supported"
   error at opening an archive file.

   Solution: install the krarc slave properly:

   Copy the kio_krarc.so, kio_krarc.la files into
   $KDEDIR/lib/kde3

   Copy the krarc.protocol file into $KDEDIR/share/services

   or the directory where the KIO slaves are placed in your
   Linux® distribution.

   7.2.7. When I try to establish an FTP connection, I get an
   error message after 'Connect OK' saying 'Could not connect to
   host'.

   You are probably behind a firewall/proxy and haven't enabled
   "Passive Mode". Enable "Passive FTP" through KDE's KDE Control
   Center and try again. KDE Control Center->Network->Preferences
   , "Enable Passive Mode (PASV)" has to be checked.

   7.2.8. I get "FTP protocol not supported by Krusader" error at
   trying to open a remote FTP directory.

   The reason for this error is that 'FTP via HTTP proxy' feature
   is not yet supported by Krusader. This error can occur at
   misconfiguring the proxy settings in KDE Control Center.
   Modify the proxy setting to not use HTTP proxy and FTP will
   work.

   7.2.9. How can I disable the default sounds e.g. when I do a
   delete action ?

   Those are the default KDE System sounds, and not related to
   Krusader. If you want to disable them globally open your KDE
   KDE Control Center (kcontrol): KDE Control Center->Sound &
   Multimedia->System Notifications , Event Source: "KDE System
   Notifications" and uncheck sound items you don't like.

   7.2.10. I get the error message "Protocol not supported by
   Krusader: "krarc:/path/to/foo-archive", when I try to open
   foo-Archive

   The icons, kio_slaves and documentation must be installed to
   the correct place in the KDE directory tree. The kio_krarc.*
   files must be in the same directory with the other KIO slaves.
   Try to locate kio_tar.* and copy/link the kio_krarc.* files to
   the same location. Don't forget to run # ldconfig on this
   directory when you're done. This problem can occur if you are
   using a 64 bit microprocessor. For more information click here
   .

   7.2.11. Where is RemoteMan, the remote connection manager ?

   RemoteMan has been replaced by our Bookmark Manager since
   Krusader 1.25-beta1. The Bookmark Manager handles local files
   and remote URL's the same way. RemoteMan is being left around
   until Krusader-1.51 to allow an easier transition and give you
   a chance to move your Bookmarks. RemoteMan was disabled since
   Krusader-1.60.

   URL transition procedure:

    1. install Krusader-1.51
    2. open the RemoteMan and connect to an FTP
    3. once inside, bookmark the current location, select a name
       and save.
    4. do this for all your connections, all the Bookmarks are
       now stored in krbookmarks.xml
    5. install Krusader-1.60, it will use krbookmarks.xml or
       import it if needed.

   7.3.1. How can I report a wish, a patch or a comment?

   An open source project's greatest strength is derived from
   getting user feedback. That is why we love to hear what you
   have to say. Your "Gripes" are our instructions. After about 6
   months, programmers can no longer see their own mistakes. It's
   natural. We want the ideas, xritiques, and feedback because we
   all want to make Krusader the best, most useful, file manager
   available anywhere. The most convenient way is to use the
   Krusader Forum. For information on what remains to be done
   look at the ToDo Forum. Adding ToDo items into the ToDo Forum
   is for developers only, but feel free to post to the New
   Features Discussion/Requests Forum for things that aren't on
   the ToDo Forum, but should be. If you have a nice feature
   request, the Krusader Krew will add your request to the
   Krusader Forum. For more information about the forum click
   here . You can reach us by mail or drop us a note in our
   Krusader Forum.

   7.3.2. How can I report a bug?

   We have an online Bug Tracking System.

   Using the online bug-tracker helps us have a clear and orderly
   way to know how many bugs are open, bug priority and
   follow-ups. It saves us the long time needed to browse the
   entire Krusader forum, searching for yesterdays bug. Please
   use this system.

   Before reporting a bug, please read the following:

    1. Use the Search function of the Krusader Forum , your bug
       might be solved already. Please DO NOT post new bugs to
       the Bug Discussion Forum (except if you are not sure that
       you have found a bug). We use it for bug discussions.
    2. Check if the bug is already posted in the online bug list
       of the Bug Tracking System.
    3. If you can't find this bug mentioned, please submit it
       into the bug tracker by clicking the "Submit New" button
       in the bug-tracker window. Please submit the following
       issues: the Krusader version used, the Linux® distribution
       + version used, and a good description of the problem.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   Note

   If possible, try to do the same operation with Konqueror or
   another KDE application. If you encounter the same problem
   then it is possibly a KIOSlaves or KDE (kdelibs) bug, and not
   a Krusader bug. Krusader uses the KDE libraries and the
   KIOSlaves for many operations. In some cases you can encounter
   problems if your distribution is incorrectly configured,
   please test it first as explained above, thanks!

   Note

   7.3.3. Does Krusader have a mailing list?

   Yes, we have 3 mailing lists. No spam, no bother, just
   Krusader. Feel free to (un)subscribe.

   Tip. our mailing lists are archived and with the URL's below
   you can view them with a browser, so that you don't even have
   to subscribe to see the mailing lists.

     * Krusader-news is used to notify Krusader users about new
       releases, major bugfixes etc. . The news can also been
       read online at latest news and in the News and
       Announcements Forum who are basically the same but
       displayed in another format.
     * Krusader-commits when the Krusader Krew commits code into
       CVS, it will be reported into this mailing list. This
       allows you to follow the Krusader development ... live!
       Want to keep track? Waiting for a certain feature/bugfix?
     * Krusader-devel-ro is a read-only copy of the developer
       mailing list of the Krusader Krew. A lot of people wanted
       to subscribe to krusader-devel, which is the
       developers-only mailing list. We had to repectfully deny
       the requests, since the list is high-traffic as it is.
       However, since we do want that you can follow us, we setup
       this mailing list which is the same as krusader-devel,
       except that it is read-only. If you want to follow the
       development on the bleeding edge, this is the place to be!
       Please note that the list is read-only, so posting is not
       allowed.

   7.3.4. Does Krusader have a IRC channel?

   Yes, we have. Feel free to talk to the Krusader Krew, and of
   course fellow-users via freenode.org servers. The server is
   irc.freenode.org, the channel is #krusader. Everyone is
   welcome.

   7.3.5. How does the Krusader forum work?

   In the spirit of freedom of speech, everything that is
   Krusader related can be discussed in our forum. It does not
   matter that you are a newcomer or an advanced user, everybody
   is welcome. An open source project's greatest strength is
   derived from getting user feedback. That is why we love to
   hear what you have to say. With your feedback we can make
   Krusader better and better; otherwise, we are not aware of
   issues you may have. But please remember the following, so
   that we can maintain some order in the chaos. ;-)

   If the Documentation, FAQ, Krusader Forum and the
   Krusader-devel-ro-search can't help you, do not hesitate to
   drop a posting in our forum. The Krusader Krew or the Krusader
   forum community is always available to help you.

   Please use the Search function of the Krusader Forum, your
   issue may have been previously discussed (this allows us to
   minimze the double/triple/... postings). If your issue has
   already been discussed in the past there is a great chance
   that you will have an instant solution for your issue/problem.
   Some issues are asked over and over again, for these issues we
   have the made the FAQ ;-) This also allows us also to spend
   more time in developing Krusader.

   The Krusader Forum is split into six sections:

     * News and Announcements Forum all the latest news.
     * Bug Discussion Forum: discussions about bugs, please DO
       NOT use the forum for bug reports (except if you are
       unsure if you have found a bug).
     * New Features Discussion/Requests Forum: discussions about
       new features for future Krusader versions.
     * ToDo Forum here you will find the list of the planned
       features. Registered users will be able to VOTE and
       COMMENT on the TODO items. Here you get the chance to push
       your favourite features (+3) and still prefer certain
       features over others (+1), if you don't care about a
       feature just simply don't vote on that feature.
       Unregistered users may only browse the ToDo Forum. The
       ToDo ranking system contains the results based on the
       votes. Adding ToDo items or removing ToDo items which have
       been implemented will be done by the Krusader Krew.
     * UserActions Forum discussions about UserActions. Posting
       your own User Actions is greatly appreciated. We plan to
       include the best ones in the next Krusader releases.
     * General Discussion Forum: everything that is Krusader
       related and doesn't belong in the other forums.

   Thanks for your cooperation!

   We are providing RSS feeds for our forums. You don't have to
   check for new posts all the time, instead the news will come
   to you! To make use of them, simply point your RSS aggregator
   to here.

   7.3.6. How can I translate Krusader to my native language?

   Please read the Krusader translation HowTo. It's not difficult
   to translate! Most anyone can do it, it just takes some time.

   7.3.7. How can I support Krusader?

   You can support Krusader in many different ways: please send
   us feedback, bug reports, patches, donations, translations,
   ...
