This file is only intended for the CVS.
It should contain a brief description of new features;
in some way an extension to the changelog.
------------------------------------------------------
When closing krusader, the tabs are saved and restored

Dropping URL-s onto the status / totals line:
  If a directory contains a lot of subdirectories, it may not possible to drop
  the URL onto the panel (on which only directories are visible). From now the
  URL can be dropped onto the status / totals line instead.

Sync-browsing:
  With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the syncbrowse-mode is
  de-/activated.
  when active, each directory-change in the specific panel is performed in the
  other too.

User-actions:
  With the useraction-system the user can make its own actions on files in the
  panel or to access krusader-internal functions with parameter directly using
  placeholder.
  The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the std.
  edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can will show/manipulate the useractions too.
  The useractions are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the
  file-structure is documentated in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML)
  Useractions can be edit/add/im-/export using a new Konfigurator-module
  (although I plan to move all action-related to a new ActionMan. for more
  info see http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
  Currently these placeholder are implemented (for details see
  UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
    Path       replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter     replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List       replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Bookmark   changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
    Clipboard  manipulates the clipboard
    Copy     copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
  A GUI-based helper for placeholder-adding is provided.
