Jump-Back:
  If you create a new tab the startup-path is saved. You can now step deep into
  the dir-tree and Ctrl-J brings you back to your starting-position.
  It's also possible to set the current directory manually as Jump-Back-Point.

useraction: new placeholder: %_ListFile()%
  is replaced by path/filename of a temporary file containing a list of items
  usefull for external scripts

Custom Selection Mode

Popular Links - krusader's answer to google-ranking :-)
  In the bookmarks menu, you'll see a new submenu called "popular urls"
  From now on, krusader keeps track of every url you visit (also remote)
  and keeps a ranking for every url. the more you visit the url, the higher
  the ranking. clicking the popular links menu displays the top 15 links
  sorted by popularity. the top is the most popular. this is easy for when
  u need to visit urls often, but don't want to create a bookmark. this 
  is also a better "history" since unlike the 'history' button, this ranking
  accumulates urls from all tabs.

  also use the two-enter dialog:
  * open it (ctrl-z or bookmarks->popular urls->popular urls(bottom of list))
  * type few letter to narrow the search
  * hit enter (you'll go to the url list)
  * hit enter again and the panel is refreshed!
  

Virtual VFS.
  This is not a virtual folder !
  but more a container for URL's from different file system.
  just perfect for displaying search results and so on...
  Action you perform on the files in this VFS are performed on the 'real' files.
  you don't just delete files from the VFS - you delete them from your hard
  drive.
  limitations:: you can't create directories inside a virtual VFS.

Primitive scripting support.
condition: KJSEmbed is installed (package: KDEbindings)
  Ctrl+Alt+J opens the JavaScript-console. There you can play around:
  try 'Krusader.setCaption("Hey Ho, Let's go!");', "Krusader.children();",
  "Krusader.child("help").slots();", "alert(Krusader.properties())"
  and "Krusader.child("help").show();"....
  In addition a new placeholder for the useraction,
  %_Script(path/to/script.js)% executes an external file.
  If the path is relative the file will be read from <KDE-app-data>/krusader/js/
  If a UserAction should execute the return of a script, set the second
  parameter of %_Script()% to "return=cmd".
  In this case the Variable 'cmd' will be read.
  additional the second parameter can be used to pass variables to the script:
  "return=lala;foo=bar". here the variable foo will have at the beginning of the
  execution the value 'bar' and the return-variable is called lala instead of cmd.
  Warning: very alpha!!

krusader has now a new toolbar: actions toolbar. you can show/hide it using
the view menu --> show actions toolbar. useful to put actions (and later
bookmarks),
put in as a side toolbar with small icons. __you'll have to overwrite
krusaderui.rc__

color scheme can now be imported/exported. reacable in the colors page
in konfigurator

disk usage (tools menu + 3rd panel)

changing the coloumns by right clicking on the panel's header

Refresh-in-the-background: from now on, reading a remote url or
the contents of an archive is done in the background. this means
that krusader remains responsive and can be used to do whatever you need
in any other panel or tab.

useraction:new placeholder %_PanelSize%
  This placeholder can change the ration between the two panels.
  %aPanelSize("80")% makes the active panel use 80% of krusader's width
  (height in vertical-mode)
  ommiting the parameter means 50%

useraction: new placeholder: %_Each%
  This placeholder splitts the commandline into a list where %_Each(...)% is
  replaced by one
  list-item (all, all files, all dirs, all selected). These commands are
  executed one after another.

Full viewer in the 3rd hand (thanks to illissius)

Shift-DEL will delete a file and not move it to the trash as DEL does.
(total commander like)

Import/Export keyboard shortcuts from/to a file. want krusader to become total
commander in a single click? no problem!

Mouse selection modes is back! check out the Look'N'Feel section

>-------------------- 1.51 --------------------------<

The long awaited feature: Fn keys can be changed to different shortcuts

Total-commander refresh: when krusader isn't focused, it is not refreshed at
all.

Pressing ctrl-up arrow from the panel, jumps to the origin bar

>-------------------- 1.50 --------------------------<

Human-readable file sizes is implemented (located in look&feel->panel)

From now on, Konqueror's right click menu is imported to Krusader

Cut (ctrl+x), Copy (ctrl+c) and Paste (ctrl+v)
  are available. They even work with Konqueror.  Please test it.

Compare by content: you can now either:
  - select (mark) one file in the left panel, and one in the right panel
  - select exactly two files in the active panel
  - make sure there is a file in the other panel with the same name as the
    current file in the active panel

Panel profiles: now it is possible to store environment profiles.
  An environment profile contains the following:
  - all the tabs path (left / right)
  - the current tab   (left / right)
  - and the selected side (left or right)
  You can save / restore these tabulator profiles. Please test it.

  Those users who use the CVS version of Krusader, should delete the
  krusaderui.rc from their home directory, to make the new menu and toolbar
  items visible.
  (rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc)

Synchronizer:  now you can use the search filters in the synchronizer

Useraction:  removed placeholder 'Bookmark'. It is deprecated now since the new
bookmark-system can be accessed directly like a user action. If you need it
anyway, use 'Goto' instead.

TC like searching: if you type 'text' -> results the same as '*text*'
You can exclude files from the search with '|' (ex. '*.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp' )

Search is possible on remote file systems as well.

If you have filesystems that you don't want to accidentally unmount (or mount),
just go to Konfigurator->Advanced, and enter a list of mountpoints separated
by commas, for example: /, /boot, /tmp) and mountman won't try to (un)mount
them.

Mountman got a big nose-job ;-) please test it well.

You can now drag'n'drop to the new tree view

Shift+left/right changes tabs (thanks to Dmitry Suzdalev)

New vfs_refresh() function only updates changes when you re-read a panel and
changes the content without the annoying full redraw effect.

When closing Krusader, the tabs are saved and restored

Synchronizer profiles:
  Krusader handles synchronizer profiles. In synchronizer press
  the 'profile' button, and you'll be able to add / load / save / remove
  synchronizer profiles.

Synchronize with Kget:
  If you want to synchronize a local directory with an unstable ftp server,
  Kget is a much better solution than simple file copying. After comparing
  you may right click on the result list and select 'Synchronize with kget'
  to execute the synchronization, after that the listed files will be
  downloaded with kget instead of Krusader.

Dropping URLs onto the status / totals line:
  If a directory contains a lot of subdirectories, it may not be possible to
  drop the URL onto the panel (on which only directories are visible). Now the
  URL can be dropped onto the status / totals line instead.

Sync-browsing:
  With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the SyncBrowse mode is
  activated/deactivated.
  When active, each directory change in the specific panel is performed in the
  other panel also.

User-Actions:
  With the user action system the user can make his own actions on files in the
  panel or access Krusader internal functions with parameters directly using the
  placeholder.
  The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the standard
  edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can show/manipulate the user actions, too.
  The user actions are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the
  file-structure is documented in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML)
  User Actions can be edited/added/im-/exported using a new Konfigurator module
  (although I plan to move all action-related to a new ActionMan. For more
  info, see http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
  Currently, these placeholder are implemented (for details see
  UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
    Path         replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter       replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List         replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Goto      changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
    Clipboard    manipulates the clipboard
    Copy     copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
    Sync      opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
    NewSearch   opens the search-windows with a given profile
    Profile     loads a given panel-profile

  A GUI-based helper for placeholder-adding is provided.
  In Path, Current and List spaces are per default automaticly escaped.
