This file is only intended for the CVS.
It should contain a brief description of new features;
in some way an extension to the changelog.
------------------------------------------------------
New vfs_refresh() function only update changes when you re-read a panel and changes
the content without the annying full redraw effect. 

When closing krusader, the tabs are saved and restored

Synchronizer profiles:
  From now krusader handles synchronizer profiles. In synchronizer press
  the 'profile' button, and you'll be able to add/ load / save / remove
  synchronizer profiles.

Synchronize with kget:
  If you want to synchronize a local directory with an instable ftp server, 
  kget is a much better solution than simple file copying. After comparing 
  you may right click on the result list and select 'Synchronize with kget'
  to execute the synchronization, after that the listed files will be 
  downloaded with kget instead of krusader.

Dropping URL-s onto the status / totals line:
  If a directory contains a lot of subdirectories, it may not possible to drop
  the URL onto the panel (on which only directories are visible). From now the
  URL can be dropped onto the status / totals line instead.

Sync-browsing:
  With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the syncbrowse-mode is
  de-/activated.
  when active, each directory-change in the specific panel is performed in the
  other too.

User-actions:
  With the useraction-system the user can make its own actions on files in the
  panel or to access krusader-internal functions with parameter directly using
  placeholder.
  The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the std.
  edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can will show/manipulate the useractions too.
  The useractions are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the
  file-structure is documentated in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML)
  Useractions can be edit/add/im-/export using a new Konfigurator-module
  (although I plan to move all action-related to a new ActionMan. for more
  info see http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
  Currently these placeholder are implemented (for details see
  UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
    Path       replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter     replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List       replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Bookmark   changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
    Clipboard  manipulates the clipboard
    Copy     copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
    Sync     opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
  A GUI-based helper for placeholder-adding is provided.
  In Path, Current and List spaces are per default automaticly escaped.
