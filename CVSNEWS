This file is only intended for the CVS.
It should contain a brief description of new features;
in some way an extension to the changelog.
------------------------------------------------------

Mouse selection modes is back! check out the Look'N'Feel section

>-------------------- 1.51 --------------------------<

The long awaited feature: Fn keys can be changed to different shortcuts

Total-commander refresh: when krusader isn't focused, it is not refreshed at all.

Pressing ctrl-up arrow from the panel, jumps to the origin bar

>-------------------- 1.50 --------------------------<

Human-readable file sizes is implemented (located in look&feel->panel)

From now on, Konqueror's right click menu is imported to Krusader

Cut (ctrl+x), Copy (ctrl+c) and Paste (ctrl+v)
  are available. They even work with Konqueror.  Please test it.

Compare by content: you can now either:
  - select (mark) one file in the left panel, and one in the right panel
  - select exactly two files in the active panel
  - make sure there is a file in the other panel with the same name as the
    current file in the active panel

Panel profiles: now it is possible to store environment profiles.
  An environment profile contains the following:
  - all the tabs path (left / right)
  - the current tab   (left / right)
  - and the selected side (left or right)
  You can save / restore these tabulator profiles. Please test it.

  Those users who use the CVS version of Krusader, should delete the
  krusaderui.rc from their home directory, to make the new menu and toolbar
  items visible.
  (rm ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc)

Synchronizer:  now you can use the search filters in the synchronizer

Useraction:  removed placeholder 'Bookmark'. It is deprecated now since the new
bookmark-system can be accessed directly like a user action. If you need it
anyway, use 'Goto' instead.

TC like searching: if you type 'text' -> results the same as '*text*'
You can exclude files from the search with '|' (ex. '*.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp' )

Search is possible on remote file systems as well.

If you have filesystems that you don't want to accidentally unmount (or mount),
just go to Konfigurator->Advanced, and enter a list of mountpoints separated
by commas, for example: /, /boot, /tmp) and mountman won't try to (un)mount
them.

Mountman got a big nose-job ;-) please test it well.

You can now drag'n'drop to the new tree view

Shift+left/right changes tabs (thanks to Dmitry Suzdalev)

New vfs_refresh() function only updates changes when you re-read a panel and
changes the content without the annoying full redraw effect.

When closing Krusader, the tabs are saved and restored

Synchronizer profiles:
  Krusader handles synchronizer profiles. In synchronizer press
  the 'profile' button, and you'll be able to add / load / save / remove
  synchronizer profiles.

Synchronize with Kget:
  If you want to synchronize a local directory with an unstable ftp server,
  Kget is a much better solution than simple file copying. After comparing
  you may right click on the result list and select 'Synchronize with kget'
  to execute the synchronization, after that the listed files will be
  downloaded with kget instead of Krusader.

Dropping URLs onto the status / totals line:
  If a directory contains a lot of subdirectories, it may not be possible to
  drop the URL onto the panel (on which only directories are visible). Now the
  URL can be dropped onto the status / totals line instead.

Sync-browsing:
  With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the SyncBrowse mode is
  activated/deactivated.
  When active, each directory change in the specific panel is performed in the
  other panel also.

User-Actions:
  With the user action system the user can make his own actions on files in the
  panel or access Krusader internal functions with parameters directly using the
  placeholder.
  The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the standard
  edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can show/manipulate the user actions, too.
  The user actions are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the
  file-structure is documented in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML)
  User Actions can be edited/added/im-/exported using a new Konfigurator module
  (although I plan to move all action-related to a new ActionMan. For more
  info, see http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
  Currently, these placeholder are implemented (for details see
  UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
    Path         replaced by the panels path
    Count      replaced by the number of <first parameter>
    Filter       replaced by the panels filter-mask
    Current    replaced by the current item
    List         replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
    Select     manipulates the selection in a panel
    Goto      changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
    Ask        asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
    Clipboard    manipulates the clipboard
    Copy     copies a file, useful for quick, local, backups
    Sync      opens the Synchronizer with a given profile
    NewSearch   opens the search-windows with a given profile
    Profile     loads a given panel-profile

  A GUI-based helper for placeholder-adding is provided.
  In Path, Current and List spaces are per default automaticly escaped.
