This file is only itended for the CVS.
It should contain a brief description of new features; in some way an extension to the changelog.


Sync-browsing:
	With a little toggle-button in the panel-level toolbar the syncbrowse-mode is de-/activated.
	when active, each directory-change in the specific panel is performed in the other too.

User-actions:
	With the useraction-system the user can make its own actions on files in the panel or to access
	krusader-internal functions with parameter directly using placeholder.
	The actions integrate seamless into KDE's action-system, so the std. edit-toolbar/shortcut-dialogs can
	will show/manipulate the useractions too.
	The useractions are stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/useraction.xml (the file-structure is ducomentated
	in doxygen-headers of UserActionXML)
	Useractions can be edit/add/im-/export using a new Konfigurator-module (although I plan to move all
	action-related to a new ActionMan. for more info see http://www.jonas-baehr.de/forum/Krusader-ideas.txt)
	Currently theese placeholder are implemented (for details see UserAction/expander.cpp or doxygen):
		Path		replaced by the panels path
		Count	replaced by the number of <first parameter>
		Filter		replaced by the panels filter-mask
		Current	replaced bythe current item
		List		replaced by a list of all <first paremeter>
		Select	manipulates the selection in a panel
		Bookmark	changes the panels's path to <first parameter>
		Ask		asks the user for a some text and is replaced by the answer
		Clipboard	manipulates the clipboard
	A GUI-based helper for placholder-adding is provided.
