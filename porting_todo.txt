	porting to kde plasma - todos
	=============================


1 - rewrite CMakeLists rules / variables

all rules were rewritten in a Qt5/KF5 way, still'kde4_add_app_icon' is missing,
I think we should find another way; I didn't changed yet the variables in
'target_link_libraries', just commented out; btw, with a fast 'cmake', all flags
should be generated (flags.make files)

next...

2 - change properly all include
