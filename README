Krusader 1.25-beta1
===================

Welcome.
The focus of this release in the new bookmark manager (thanks to Jan Halasa).
The new system offers support for local AND remote bookmarks, so bookman and
remoteman are now obsolete. Please test it, and let us know.

Also, as usual some bugfixes, a new Hungarian translation and two updated ones.
For more information, please check the changelog.

Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do it using krusader's website, and
        not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).

            as always, enjoy
                 Krusader Krew.
