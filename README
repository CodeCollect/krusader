Krusader-2.1.0-SVN "Rusty Clutch"
=================================
Development version for the upcomming Krusader-2.1.0 series.
This version should be considered as UNSTABLE since we are adding/testing new features.

NOTE: Since Krusader-2.1.0 development is done in KDE extragear.


Krusader-2.0.0 "Mars Pathfinder"
================================
The Krew is proud to present the first stable KDE4 release of your favourite
file manager! The development process was all about porting, all dependencies to
the Qt3 support libs have been removed. This is the first stable that comes with
experimental support for the Windows platform. Who thought that day will ever
come?

Even though this release contains quite a bunch of new features our main focus
was to create a KDE4 version that is ready for everyday use. Overall the release
is very usable but might contain bugs that haven't been present in prior
versions. Please provide us bug reports, feedback and patches to make it as
solid as the KDE3 version. Many thanks to everyone who supported us in the
porting process!

The highlights of this release are:

- Archive dialog now remembers Compression level
- View properties for detailed/brief/interviews are merged into one
- Bugfixes
- I18n updates

Changes since 2.0.0-beta2 (but not limited to): 

- Queue manager
  Enqueue operation for copy / move operations
  Use F5 (copy) or F6 (move) and than F2 to enqueue
  Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue (SHIFT+F5), move by queue (SHIFT+F6)
- Five sorting methods
- Support for tar.lzma (KDE's tar protocol doesn't support it yet)
- Konfigurator mouse selection mode: Possibility to select a predefined
  mode and change a detail.
- Highlight quick search match
- Useractions: added checkbox "enabled"
  and run mode option "Run in embedded terminal emulator"
- The description of a dir contains its size if it is known
- Many, many bugfixes

Changes since 2.0.0-beta1 (but not limited to): 

- Ported to KDE4 not using any of the Qt3 support libs
- Experimental support for the Windows platform
- Send emails with Thunderbird
- Attach multiple files to emails
- Submenus for categories in UserAction menu and context menu
- Select encoding in content search and krarc
- New synchronizer shortcuts

To checkout Krusader-2.x for KDE4 from SVN:

http://subversion.tigris.org/
And than run the next command:
$ svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/utils/krusader/
  
Please not that the above command doesn't download the translations and the Krusader handbook,
since their code resides in other directories.
TODO: We have not written a script for that yet, but it should be done once we will release
Krusader-2.1.0

A quick hack to get and install the German Krusader GUI l10n: 
$ wget http://websvn.kde.org/*checkout*/trunk/l10n-kde4/de/messages/extragear-utils/krusader.po
$ msgfmt krusader.po -o krusader.mo
