Krusader 1.01
=============
This version is a bug fix release for the v1.00
(mainly compilation and compatabilty bugs).
It also mark the birth of the Krusader II branch as this version comes in two
flavours: KDE2 & KDE3.
The KDE3 version is basicly a port of the KDE2 version, but the ftp/smb VFS
was re-written so it's not well tested as the KDE2 version.
