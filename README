Krusader-2.0.0-beta2 "Space Odyssey"
==================================
The Krew is proud to present the second KDE4 release of your favourite file
manager! This beta is all about porting, all dependencies to the Qt3 support
libs have been removed. This is also the second release that comes with 
experimental support for the Windows platform. Who thought that day will ever
come?

Even though this release contains some new features our main focus is to create
a stable KDE4 version. Overall the release is usable but surely contains bugs
that haven't been present in prior versions. Please provide us bug reports,
feedback and patches to make it as solid as the KDE3 version. Many thanks to
everyone who supported us in the porting process!

The highlights of this release are:
- many many bugfixes
- Queue manager
  Enqueue operation for copy / move operations
  Use F5 (copy) or F6 (move) and than F2 to enqueue.
  Or the direct shortcuts: copy by queue (SHIFT+F5), move by queue (SHIFT+F6).
- Five sortingmethods
- Konfigurator mouse selection mode: Possibility to select a predefined
  mode and change a detail. 
- highlight quick search match
- Useractions: added checkbox "enabled"
  and run mode option "Run in embedded terminal emulator"
- the description of a dir contains its size if it is known

Read SVNNEWS for more detailed information about the new features.

Changes since 2.0.0-beta1 (but not limited to): 

- Ported to KDE4 not using any of the Qt3 support libs
- Experimental support for the Windows platform
- Send emails with Thunderbird
- Attach multiple files to emails
- Submenus for categories in UserAction menu and context menu
- Select encoding in content search and krarc
- New synchronizer shortcuts

For more explenations about the new features please read the
SVNNEWS file in this tarball.

Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do so using Krusader's
        website, and not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).

            as always, enjoy

For GUI Translators
===================
Translation procedure
---------------------
Before we release a stable version of Krusader, we bring out at least
one beta version. From that moment on there is a feature freeze and only
bugs will be fixed. This means that translators can update their
translations, for the coming stable. Normally, all the Krusader
translators will receive an e-mail from Dirk Eschler, to invite you for
translating Krusader. We will update all foo.po files against
krusader.pot just before the beta will be released, so that you will
only have to edit the new foo.po file with Kbabel. This way you don't
have to worry anymore about how foo.po must be updated. In the past some
translators updated foo.po in a wrong way, so they translated obsolete
messages, we want to prevent this, of course.

With i18n_status and ViewCVS to see the live translation status of
Krusader!
http://krusader.org/i18n.php
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/krusader/krusader_kde3/po/
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the LATEST
NEWS section of the "Krusader translation howto".

New translations
----------------
If your native language is not listed in VIEWCVS, you will have to
translate Krusader to your native language. Dirk Eschler is the Krusader
i18n coordinator, please contact him if you intend to translate Krusader
to your native language.

Krusader translation howto
--------------------------
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some
help. The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the
LATEST NEWS section. This allows that even beginners or non-programmers
can translate Krusader to their native language. Please have a look at
http://krusader.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389

Quickstart procedure for translators updating existing translations (kde3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Run KDE in your native language.

2.
Checkout the latest available version of Krusader from CVS. Or if you
are not familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS snapshot
(nightly tarball) from http://krusader.org/cvs.php, and run:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

3.
Translate your foo.po with Kbabel.
Note: We will update all foo.po files just before the beta will be
released.

4.
Compile foo.po, for error checking (from the po directory):
$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to step 3.

5.
Run the commands of step 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation.
Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo steps 3-5).

6.
If everything is ok, send the updated translation to Dirk Eschler.
