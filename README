Krusader 1.21-beta1
===================

Welcome to the latest unstable release of krusader.
This one has a lot of bugfixes and some new features.
Some of the highlights are:
* new KIO slave for handling archives. This is a work in progress, which
  takes krusader's archive handling to new places ;-) The NEW mechanism
  handles tar,gz,bz2 and zip, and accessing these archives should be much
  faster. Notice that this feature is really beta. A known issue is that
  handling really large ZIP files is slow (>500MB).
* Krusader now uses in-place renaming (thanks to Heiner Eichmann)
* Support for multi-file properties dialog
* Total-Commander-like directory selection. Select a directory using SPACE
  to check out this feature (thanks to Heiner Eichmann)
* A much requested feature: opening the left/right bookmark list (done using
  alt+left/right arrow) is now an action. You can change the keyboard shortcuts
  for it.
* Fix for panel flicker bug
* Fix for search module
* Fix for using KRename with files containing spaces (thanks to Tobias Vogele)
* Updated translations
* Many i18n issues (thanks to Frank Schoolmeesters)
* A lot of usability issues were fixed (thanks to Mikolaj Machowski)

For more information, please check the changelog.
Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do it using krusader's website, and
        not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org). 

            as always, enjoy
                 Krusader Krew.
