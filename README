Krusader 1.29-beta
==================
We're glad to release 1.29-beta. Hopefully, the last beta before
releasing stable 1.30. This release introduces a lot of bugfixes,
but some new (and may we say exciting ?) features:

* Tabbed-Browsing.
  Check out right-click on a directory --> open in a new tab ;-)
* ROOT-mode: press ALT-K (or Commands->Root-mode krusader) to start krusader in root-mode at the same location
* Shift-F4 edits a new file (total-commander style)
* Shift-F3 views a url on demand - try man:/printf
* CTRL-Enter / CTRL-shift-Enter sends files to command line (again, TC-style)
* Highly request panel swapping (ctrl-u)
* Improved command line (check ChangeLog for details)
* Multiple files sharing a mimetype can be "open"ed together via right-click menu
* Calculate-occupied-space can now be cancelled
* Pressing SPACE over folders calculates their size (TC-style)
* Last but certainly not least, improvements to archive handling, including KIO-rar support
* Many bugfixes... read ChangeLog

This version effects a feature-freeze until the stable, only bugs will be fixed. This means
that translators can use the time to update their translations, for the comming stable.


Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do it using krusader's website, and
        not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).

            as always, enjoy
                 Krusader Krew.
