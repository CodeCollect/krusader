Krusader Version 1.20
=====================

We are proud to release the latest stable version of Krusader.
There have been a lot of changes from the former stable version 1.11, but
the most important change is the new panel GUI engine that will allow us
to implement features that weren't possible before.

There are also bugfixes from the last beta. Thanks to all of you who submitted
bugs and translations - you know who you are (and you're credited too)!


            as always, enjoy
                 the Krusader Krew.
