 * configuring the colors of the panel
 * quickmode for mountman. press and HOLD the mountman icon for new functionality
 * ability to enable/disable icons in the views (filelists)
 * Konfigurator was re-written by Csaba, and has lots of new things in it.
 * Ability to configure the fields of the panel (Ext, Size, Perm, ...)
 * Single click selection mode
 * Panel level toolbar ('..', '/', '~', '=' buttons), thanks to David Harel
 * A Locate frontend (integrating the findutils-locate package of GNU into Krusader). TEST IT
 * A Quicksearch a-la totalCommander. Thanks to heiner.
 * Ability to edit/view file in the search result window (F3, F4, right click)
 * A folder-history button, a-la-total commander. thanks to Hans Loffler!
 * A directory synchronizer (thanks to Csaba). TEST IT
 * A file splitter module
Also, many bugs have been fixed, including:
 * internal editor quits without notification even if the edited file was not saved
 * KDE 3.2 terminal exit at Ctrl+C
 * bug [ 906386 ] regarding refreshes of dirwatch with fam enabled
 * bug [ 906538 ] which now makes a faster unpacking process
 * bug [ 894771 ] regarding over-expanding window due to long command line
 * permission handling for FTP URL-s
 * no restart at changing the icon tray's state in konfigurator
 * krusader freezes if the `df` process does not terminate (at network errors, IO wait)
 * increased speed of search, by emitting lesssignals (thanks to Lars)
 * statusbar updated only on mouse clicks, not on keyboard
 * crash at rename if the directory is refreshed by the watcher
 * crash at ftp://user@server@proxy:port FTP URL-s

For Translators
===============
1.
Download the latest available version of Krusader with a checkout from CVS.
Or if you are not familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS
sourcecode snapshot (nightly tarball) from
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php
and run
$ make -f Makefile.cvs

2.
Update krusader.pot (translation template file) before running "$ make"
(extracting all the English text from the sourcecode)
Please don't forget to do this step, otherwise you will translate obsolete messages.
$ make -f admin/Makefile.common package-messages

3.
Update foo.po (in the po directory), for existing translations only
./po/$ msgmerge foo.po krusader.pot --output-file=foo.po

4.
translate foo.po with Kbabel (Kbabel is easy to use)

5.
compile foo.po (in the po directory)
./po/$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo

6.
If you have a new or updated translation, please send it to Dirk.

TIP
We have a verry detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need more info,
this allows that even beginners or non-programmers can translate Krusader to
their native language. Please look at

Package Description
===================
Krusader is an advanced twin-panel (commander-style) file-manager for KDE 3.x
(similar to Midnight or Total Commander) but with many extras.
It provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced search module,
viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and
much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj and rpm
and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly,
fast and looks great on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
