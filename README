Many many things have changed, so here's some highlights:

* New user-action system, which allows you to define your own
  personal krusader-actions.
  Please take a look at the tutorial that comes in the doc\ section
* Profiles: you can now save a profile that contains the entire tabs on both
  panels, and restore the state at will. See the new profiles icon.
* 3rd Panel: new popup-panel that can display quick view, tree etc. Just click
  the little arrow button on the bottom of each panel.
* A new, compare directories menu. TC-Style
* Support for selecting certain protcols for certain mime-types
* ISO protocol now allows you to step into .iso files
* Cut, Copy and Paste: ctrl-v, ctrl-c and ctrl-x is working
* Konqueror's right-click actions are shown in Krusader
* Human-readable size in the file list (optional)
* ALT-O now synchronizes the panels (other panel becomes as current)
* CTRL-D opens the bookmark in the active panel - TotalCommander style
* Search now includes support for profiles
* Search now searches on remote filesystems
* Search: TC like search ( 'text' == '*text*' ),
  excluding files with '|' (ex. '*.cpp *.h | *.moc.cpp' )
* Packing/Unpacking to/from remote URL is supported.
* Arj, Lha, and ace are now fully supported
* Two single-click Rename (total commander-like)
* New refresh method, should make Krusader take less cpu time

and that's without mentioning other features and COUNTLESS bug fixes.
Please check the changelog for information, as many high-profile bugs were fixed.

Notice: if you've got bugs to report, please do so using Krusader's website,
        and not using KDE's bugzilla (bugs.kde.org).

For Translators
===============
Translation procedure
---------------------
Before we release a stable version of Krusader, we bring out at least one beta
version. From that moment on there is a feature freeze and only bugs will be
fixed. This means that translators can update their translations, for the
coming stable. Normally, all the Krusader translators will receive an e-mail
from Dirk Eschler, to invite you for translating Krusader. We will update all
foo.po files against krusader.pot just before the beta will be released, so that
you will only have to edit the new foo.po file with Kbabel. This way you don't
have to worry anymore about how foo.po must be updated. In the past some
translators updated foo.po in a wrong way, so they translated obsolete messages,
we want to prevent this, of course.

With VIEWCVS you get a LIVE translation status with your browser at
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/krusader/krusader_kde3/po/
Look at the "Last log entry" column to see the translation status (don't look at
the age column). The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the
LATEST NEWS section of the "Krusader translation howto".

New translations
----------------
If your native language is not listed in VIEWCVS, you will have to translate
Krusader to your native language. Dirk Eschler is the Krusader i18n coordinator,
please contact him if you intend to translate Krusader to your native language.

Krusader translation howto
--------------------------
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some help.
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the LATEST NEWS
section. This allows that even beginners or non-programmers can translate
Krusader to their native language. Please have a look at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389

Quickstart procedure for advanced translators who update an existing translation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Run KDE in your native language.

2.
Checkout the latest available version of Krusader from CVS. Or if you are not
familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS snapshot (nightly tarball)
from http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php, and run:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

3.
Translate your foo.po with Kbabel.
Note: We will update all foo.po files just before the beta will be released.

4.
Compile foo.po, for error checking (from the po directory):
$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to step 3.

5.
Run the commands of step 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation.
Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo steps 3-5).

6.
If everything is ok, send the updated translation to Dirk Eschler.

Package Description
===================
Krusader is an advanced twin-panel (commander-style) file-manager for KDE 3.x
(similar to Midnight or Total Commander) but with many extras.
It provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj
and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks great
on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
