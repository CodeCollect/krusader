Krusader 1.70.0-beta2 (Afterburner)
===============================
Welcome is the 2nd beta in the 1.70.x series. 
Download it, play with it, push it to the limit, break it if you can,
and then tell us what you found! 

IMPORTANT: Please remove your ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc file after installation!!!
(Else you won't see new menu entries. But please note: This will also reset all your changes on
toolbars and shortcuts!)

Changes since beta1 include (but not limited to):
* Improvements in the checksum module
* More control over the terminal emulator (requested feature)
* Our modified KIO-TAR is now built only when passing --with-kiotar to configure
* Bugfixes to bookmarks, viewer and much more
* A fix for a nasty bug that was plagueing people with gcc 4.x  

Krusader v1.70.0 contains over 40 changes, bug fixes and updates in
response to reports and requests from our users.
The highlights are:

New Modules/Features
--------------------
* New zip/tar slave - based on KDE's but support writing to archive
* A Safari-like Jump-Back feature (Ctrl-J and in the bookmark-menu)
* Quick Navigation: hold the CTRL button and move the mouse over 
  the text in the url bar to see this new feature in action
* checksum creation/verification mechanism that supports
  md5, sha1, sha256, tiger, whirlpool. external supported tools are md5deep and cfv.
* editor/viewer is now tabbed. Configure it in General->Viewer
* Viewer has a new placeholder for the UserActions which allows
  to open the viewer with different view- and window-modes:
  %_View("filename", "view-mode", "window-mode")%
* filters for selecting files - click "select files" to see how
* column types can be changed and saved individually to each panel (each side).
  right click on the column names to use this mechanism
* When searching for text inside files, the result will display the line
  in which the requested was found.
* select remote encoding menu for fish, ftp and sftp protocols.
  Accessible via a new subemenu in the Command menu.

* preserve date for local targets on copy / move operations
* starting krusader with more tabs, using --left=tab1,tab2,tab3 --right=tab4,tab5
* Use WhatsThis in favour of tooltips where reasonable
and more ...


Usability
---------
* Ctrl-L goes to the location bar (url bar), as in konqueror and firefox
* Ctrl-Alt-ENTER opens the selected folder in a new tab
* Alt-Ctrl-S creates a new symlink
* Ctrl-H opens the history list on the current panel (much like ctrl-d)
* When starting krusader for the first time, auto detection of tools is
  displayed in a more coherent and good looking way
* Trash, delete and shred options are added directly into the right click menu
* Right-click menu now has a "Create new" submenu
* New "clear location bar" button, a-la Konqueror
* Krusader's icon is set according to user's priveldges

Honestly, we didn't consider donations, until users asked us for a way to
donate to the project. Developing Krusader can be a full time job at times,
and even though it is very time consuming, we all enjoy it, and want to see
the project becomes even better. Donations for this project will be used for
further development of Krusader, be it by purchasing hardware, or promoting
of the project.


For Translators
===============
Translation procedure
---------------------
Before we release a stable version of Krusader, we bring out at least one beta
version. From that moment on there is a feature freeze and only bugs will be
fixed. This means that translators can update their translations, for the
coming stable. Normally, all the Krusader translators will receive an e-mail
from Dirk Eschler, to invite you for translating Krusader. We will update all
foo.po files against krusader.pot just before the beta will be released, so that
you will only have to edit the new foo.po file with Kbabel. This way you don't
have to worry anymore about how foo.po must be updated. In the past some
translators updated foo.po in a wrong way, so they translated obsolete messages,
we want to prevent this, of course.

With i18n_status and ViewCVS to see the live translation status of Krusader! 
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/i18n.php
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/krusader/krusader_kde3/po/
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the
LATEST NEWS section of the "Krusader translation howto".

New translations
----------------
If your native language is not listed in VIEWCVS, you will have to translate
Krusader to your native language. Dirk Eschler is the Krusader i18n coordinator,
please contact him if you intend to translate Krusader to your native language.

Krusader translation howto
--------------------------
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some help.
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the LATEST NEWS
section. This allows that even beginners or non-programmers can translate
Krusader to their native language. Please have a look at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389

Quickstart procedure for advanced translators who update an existing translation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Run KDE in your native language.

2.
Checkout the latest available version of Krusader from CVS. Or if you are not
familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS snapshot (nightly tarball)
from http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php, and run:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

3.
Translate your foo.po with Kbabel.
Note: We will update all foo.po files just before the beta will be released.

4.
Compile foo.po, for error checking (from the po directory):
$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to step 3.

5.
Run the commands of step 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation.
Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo steps 3-5).

6.
If everything is ok, send the updated translation to Dirk Eschler.

Package Description
===================
Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE
and other desktops in the *nix world, similar to Midnight or Total Commander.
It provides all the file management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj,
lha and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks great
on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
