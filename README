Krusader Version 1.20
============================

We are proud to give the latest stable krusader version.
There have been a lot of changes from the former stable version 1.11 but
the most important change was the new panel GUI engine that will allow us
to implemnt features that weren't possible before.

There also some bugfixes from the last beta, thanks to all of you who submitted bugs
and translations - you know who you are !


            as always, enjoy
                 the Krusader Krew.
