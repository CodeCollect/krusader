Package Description:
====================
Krusader is an advanced twin-panel (commander-style) file-manager for KDE 3.x
(similar to Midnight or Total Commander) but with many extras.
It provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced search module,
viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and
much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj and rpm
and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly,
fast and looks great on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
