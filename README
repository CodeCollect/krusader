Krusader 1.70.0 "Round Robin"
=============================
The Krew is pleased to announce the stable release of Krusader 1.70.0.
Introducing many new, expert features as well as many operational and
visibility enhancements. With this release Krusader is heading straight
to its second milestone, bringing a feature rich file manager with new
technologies and standards to the Linux desktop. We would like to thank
the developers, translators, and the rest of the community for keeping
us sharp, for beta testing and using our file manager and for your
feedback, which makes this product one of the greatest.

IMPORTANT: Remove your krusaderui.rc
************************************************************************
Please remove your ~/.kde/share/apps/krusader/krusaderui.rc file after
installation!!! (Else you won't see new menu entries. But please note:
this will also reset all your changes on toolbars and shortcuts!)
************************************************************************

IMPORTANT: Crashes in Krusader caused by Qt 3.3.5
************************************************************************
We've been getting a lot of emails and bug reports regarding random
crashes in Krusader, especially during some file operations (copy/move
etc.). These crashes are related to Qt 3.3.5 and NOT Krusader.
It seems that Qt 3.3.5 introduced a serious bug which is now causing
random crashes in many KDE applications including Konqueror. You can
google for it to find out more. 

As far as we know, debian and suse already posted new Qt binaries that
fix the problem, and gentoo has masked Qt 3.3.5 completely.
As for now, you either need Qt 3.3.4 or a fixed Qt 3.3.5, depending on
your distribution. For more information is available on our website at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=1407
************************************************************************

Krusader v1.70.0 contains over 40 changes, bug fixes and updates in

For Translators
===============
Translation procedure
---------------------
Before we release a stable version of Krusader, we bring out at least
one beta version. From that moment on there is a feature freeze and only
bugs will be fixed. This means that translators can update their
translations, for the coming stable. Normally, all the Krusader
translators will receive an e-mail from Dirk Eschler, to invite you for
translating Krusader. We will update all foo.po files against
krusader.pot just before the beta will be released, so that you will
only have to edit the new foo.po file with Kbabel. This way you don't
have to worry anymore about how foo.po must be updated. In the past some
translators updated foo.po in a wrong way, so they translated obsolete
messages, we want to prevent this, of course.

With i18n_status and ViewCVS to see the live translation status of
Krusader!
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/i18n.php
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/krusader/krusader_kde3/po/
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the LATEST
NEWS section of the "Krusader translation howto".

New translations
----------------
If your native language is not listed in VIEWCVS, you will have to
translate Krusader to your native language. Dirk Eschler is the Krusader
i18n coordinator, please contact him if you intend to translate Krusader
to your native language.

Krusader translation howto
--------------------------
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some
help. The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the
LATEST NEWS section. This allows that even beginners or non-programmers
can translate Krusader to their native language. Please have a look at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389

Quickstart procedure for translators updating existing translations
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Run KDE in your native language.

2.
Checkout the latest available version of Krusader from CVS. Or if you
are not familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS snapshot
(nightly tarball) from http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php, and run:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

3.
Translate your foo.po with Kbabel.
Note: We will update all foo.po files just before the beta will be
released.

4.
Compile foo.po, for error checking (from the po directory):
$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to step 3.

5.
Run the commands of step 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation.
Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo steps 3-5).

6.
If everything is ok, send the updated translation to Dirk Eschler.
