Krusader 1.40-beta1
===================
Finally, it's here. This beta is the first in the 1.40 series. A lot has happened
since 1.30, and we're quite execited over 1.40, and hope you are too.
Some of the big changes are:
 * new icons for krusader (thanks to adios for providing them)
 * configuring the colors of the panel
 * quickmode for mountman. press and HOLD the mountman icon for new functionality
 * ability to enable/disable icons in the views (filelists)
 * Konfigurator was re-written by Csaba, and has lots of new things in it.
 * Ability to configure the fields of the panel (Ext, Size, Perm, ...)
 * Single click selection mode
 * Panel level toolbar ('..', '/', '~', '=' buttons), thanks to David Harel
 * A Locate frontend (integrating the findutils-locate package of GNU into Krusader). TEST IT
 * A Quicksearch a-la totalCommander. Thanks to heiner.
 * Ability to edit/view file in the search result window (F3, F4, right click)
 * A folder-history button, a-la-total commander. thanks to Hans Loffler!
 * A directory synchronizer (thanks to Csaba). TEST IT
 * A file splitter module
Also, many bugs have been fixed, including:
 * internal editor quits without notification even if the edited file was not saved
 * KDE 3.2 terminal exit at Ctrl+C
 * bug [ 906386 ] regarding refreshes of dirwatch with fam enabled
 * bug [ 906538 ] which now makes a faster unpacking process
 * bug [ 894771 ] regarding over-expanding window due to long command line
 * permission handling for FTP URL-s
 * no restart at changing the icon tray's state in konfigurator
 * krusader freezes if the `df` process does not terminate (at network errors, IO wait)
 * increased speed of search, by emitting lesssignals (thanks to Lars)
 * statusbar updated only on mouse clicks, not on keyboard
 * crash at rename if the directory is refreshed by the watcher
 * crash at ftp://user@server@proxy:port FTP URL-s
 * no parent directory at tar://... and zip://... URL-s

As you can see, a lot has happened, and we need help to test it.

For Translators
===============
DETAILED PROCEDURE
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some help.
Also the latest news about the Krusader translations can be found here.
This allows that even beginners or non-programmers can translate Krusader to
their native language. Please look at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389


QUICKSTART PROCEDURE
1.
Run your Linux distribution in your native language

2.
Download the latest available version of Krusader with a checkout from CVS.
Or if you are not familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS
sourcecode snapshot (nightly tarball) from
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php
and run
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make -f admin/Makefile.common package-messages
$ su -c 'make install'

NOTE: The command "make -f admin/Makefile.common package-messages"
      will update krusader.pot = the translation template file
      (extracting all the English text from the sourcecode).
      Please don't forget to do this step, otherwise you will translate obsolete messages.
      It is important that this command is used AFTER the "make" command,
      otherwise not everything is extracted from the sourcecode.

3.
- Existing translation:
  Update foo.po (in the po directory)
  ./po/$ msgmerge foo.po krusader.pot --output-file=foo.po

- New translation:
  To know your language abreviation foo run:  $ echo $LANG
  (ex.: nl = Dutch, fr = French, it = Italian, ...)
  Or look at the KDE language abreviation list at http://i18n.kde.org/teams/
  Open krusader.pot with Kbabel and "save as" foo.po

4.
translate foo.po with Kbabel (Kbabel is easy to use, please read its manual)

5.
compile foo.po, for error checking (in the po directory)
./po/$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to nr. 3

6.
Run the commands of nr. 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation
btw. If you have a new translation: "make -f Makefile.cvs" will modify
     the Makefiles in the krusader_kde3/po directory.
     From now on your new translation will be compiled and installed :)

Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo nr. 4,5,6), and test again.

7.
If everything is ok, send the new or updated translation to Dirk.

==================
Krusader is developed by a dedicated team of individuals, known as the Krusader Krew.
- Shie Erlich,  author <erlich@users.sourceforge.net>
- Rafi Yanai,   author <yanai@users.sourceforge.net>
- Dirk Eschler, webmaster and i18n coordinator <deschler@users.sourceforge.net>

Package Description
===================
Krusader is an advanced twin-panel (commander-style) file-manager for KDE 3.x
(similar to Midnight or Total Commander) but with many extras.
It provides all the file-management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced search module,
viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content comparisons, powerful batch renaming and
much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj and rpm
and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly,
fast and looks great on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
