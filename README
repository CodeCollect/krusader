Krusader 1.60.0 final
=====================
First, as you might have noticed, krusader uses a new version scheme. 
The idea behind the new scheme is quite simple really:
First digit - the major version
Second digit(s) - percentage of features completed for this major version
third digit(s) - bugfixes.
So in essence, releasing 1.60.0, means that we believe that krusader is about 60%
done with all the features we'd schedule for thr 1.x.x series. Only 40% left to
go until version 2.0.0 ;-) We hope it'd be easy to understand.

As usual, a lot of bugfixes and a lot of features. some of the interesting ones:
* Ability to select you own color scheme. Comes with total-commander and midnight-commander
  color schemes by default. Try Konfigurator->Colors->Import Color-Scheme
* Import/Export keyboard shortcuts. Comes with a total-commander keybindings scheme.
* 4 Selection Modes to choose from. The last one is actually a user-defined selection mode.
* Many improvements to the user-action system. Included are some actions suggested by
  our users in the forum.
* Popular Urls - Krusader keeps a list of the most visited urls, and allows you to _quickly_
  go anywhere you need. Click ctrl-Z to give it a try
* Virtual Vfs: an implementation of virtual folders. To try it, perform a search and click
  "feed to listbox". Also, you can type something like "virt:/test1" into the origin bar
* Bookmarks can now be placed into toolbars, and krusader has a new "action toolbar" especially
  for user actions and bookmarks
* When opening a remote url or an archive, krusader does not block the user interface. you can
  keep working in any other panel or tab while krusader opens the remote location.
* Many improvements to the synchronizer module
* A new disk-usage module. Available either by ALT-D, or by choosing the component in the 3rd panel.
* A new full-viewer (as opposed to a thumbnail viewer) in the 3rd panel.

enjoy!

Honestly, we didn't consider donations, until users asked us for a way to
donate to the project. Developing Krusader can be a full time job at times,
and even though it is very time consuming, we all enjoy it, and want to see
the project becomes even better. Donations for this project will be used for
further development of Krusader, be it by purchasing hardware, or promoting
of the project.


For Translators
===============
Translation procedure
---------------------
Before we release a stable version of Krusader, we bring out at least one beta
version. From that moment on there is a feature freeze and only bugs will be
fixed. This means that translators can update their translations, for the
coming stable. Normally, all the Krusader translators will receive an e-mail
from Dirk Eschler, to invite you for translating Krusader. We will update all
foo.po files against krusader.pot just before the beta will be released, so that
you will only have to edit the new foo.po file with Kbabel. This way you don't
have to worry anymore about how foo.po must be updated. In the past some
translators updated foo.po in a wrong way, so they translated obsolete messages,
we want to prevent this, of course.

With i18n_status and ViewCVS to see the live translation status of Krusader! 
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/i18n.php
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/krusader/krusader_kde3/po/
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the
LATEST NEWS section of the "Krusader translation howto".

New translations
----------------
If your native language is not listed in VIEWCVS, you will have to translate
Krusader to your native language. Dirk Eschler is the Krusader i18n coordinator,
please contact him if you intend to translate Krusader to your native language.

Krusader translation howto
--------------------------
We have a very detailed "Krusader translation howto" if you need some help.
The latest news about the Krusader translations can be in the LATEST NEWS
section. This allows that even beginners or non-programmers can translate
Krusader to their native language. Please have a look at
http://krusader.sourceforge.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=389

Quickstart procedure for advanced translators who update an existing translation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Run KDE in your native language.

2.
Checkout the latest available version of Krusader from CVS. Or if you are not
familiar with CVS, download the latest Krusader CVS snapshot (nightly tarball)
from http://krusader.sourceforge.net/cvs.php, and run:
$ make -f Makefile.cvs
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -c "make install"

3.
Translate your foo.po with Kbabel.
Note: We will update all foo.po files just before the beta will be released.

4.
Compile foo.po, for error checking (from the po directory):
$ msgfmt foo.po --statistics -c -v --output-file=foo.gmo
If it reports "xx fuzzy translations" or "xx untranslated messages",
please return to step 3.

5.
Run the commands of step 2 to reinstall the new or updated translation.
Run Krusader and test your native translations.
If necessary fix the foo.po file (redo steps 3-5).

6.
If everything is ok, send the updated translation to Dirk Eschler.

Package Description
===================
Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE
and other desktops in the *nix world, similar to Midnight or Total Commander.
It provides all the file management features you could possibly want.
Plus: extensive archive handling, mounted filesystem support, FTP, advanced
search module, viewer/editor, directory synchronisation, file content
comparisons, powerful batch renaming and much much more.
It supports the following archive formats: tar, zip, bzip2, gzip, rar, ace, arj,
lha and rpm and can handle other KIOSlaves such as smb:// or fish://
It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly, fast and looks great
on your desktop! :-)

You should give it a try.
